"Lenovo Ref: ** (why create a ref. no. if you do not wish to ever respond?). Sales man took our order for a 11e Yoga Gen 6 Laptop 20Se WITH a Pen for our 9 yrs old son. That Pen was Back Ordered, was credited. Then re-charged our C.C. Finally shipped a wrong GENERATION 5 PEN! Wrongly delivered pen is not being attended to, despite repeated calls FOR HOURS AND HOURS to ALL DEPARTMENTS including Sales, Customer Service, Technical Support, etc. After Sales Service Sucks. WARNING: Do not buy anything Lenovo if you hope for service or value for your dollars. DO NOT BUY ANY LENOVO. PERIOD."
"Hello, 3 months ago Lenovo prompted me to do ""critical update"" on my Laptop. It resulted in broken machine. I have been chasing their technical support and then customer support for 3 months. The diagnosis was performed by phone and based on the ""troubleshooting"" that went through all the options that I have already tried myself, it was concluded I need some parts replacement. No physical examination was conducted. Then I was informed that Lenovo does not have the parts to fix my laptop."
"I bought my first Lenovo laptop 10 years ago and just recently bought my second. The first one still works perfectly. It starts up quickly, has good battery life, and almost never has issues with freezing etc. The keyboard, touch screen, trackpad, screen, everything all work like new. And I'm not a light computer user, I'm sure it averages 4-8 hours per day of use and it always travels with me. I look forward to another 10 years with the one I just bought. Lenovo's build quality is exceptional. I'll probably never buy another brand."
"As the other recent reviewers have said, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT! Their Customer Support is a joke- a bad one! They actually HUNG UP on the Manager of Staples who was trying to help me solve my problem."
"In short, do not buy a Lenovo laptop. Their customer service is terrible (long wait times, got transferred 2x), you won't get any help for issues you have with the laptop. It's not worth it. I tried to return the laptop with no success."
"This company made me wait so long for a laptop that I cancelled the order. They convinced me to buy a more expensive replacement that would ship sooner. The more expensive replacement showed up with a bad hard drive and restarted itself every 5 minutes. It was absolutely unusable. Today I spent 1 hour on the phone with Tech ""Support"", 30 minutes with Returns, and 30 minutes with a sales representative. They offered me two even more expensive options, no discount, no apologies. Just the absolute worst. I work in IT and I'm never going to recommend this company to employers, customers or friends. In fact, I will do the opposite and try to cost this company more than giving me a discount would have."
"This is Sugam. I really disappointed with Lenovo. I bought a Lenovo Laptop in Jan 2021 Model (Lenovo v15 ADA ) S/N (PF20LPJH). In same year (in Oct-NOV) month first time my Laptop was damaged and problem was (in Power button), on that time your filed boy has changed whole part of my laptop including motherboard. Now also from April 2022 my Laptop is not working properly and your service center persons said that you have to change motherboard. If I have to change motherboard every after 6-7 months and pay 8-10 thousand so I don't think it is good for me, is this my profit or yours. This is my biggest mistake I have done. I can not buy Lenovo in my future and also I can't suggest to my friends also...."
I purchased a brand new Lenovo Ideapad 330s from lenovo dealer-
"I purchased a Lenovo laptop for work less than two years ago. Less than a year ago, the charging port failed so they replaced the motherboard. I purchased an extended warranty and less than a year later, the port failed again. After two days and four hours of phone calls (plus two hang ups by them), I still don't have resolution. They are trying to tell me the extended warranty doesn't cover the motherboard. They are also creating hoop after hoop to ""validate"" the onsite repair (including asking me if I am willing to wear full protective gear - scrubs, masks, etc. for Covid protection). This is the worst company ever. Their customer service is horrible, they don't care about their customers, and their products are subpar. Choose any company but this one for your computer needs."
This company will make all kinds of promises about what kinds of services and benefits you will get from the premium warranty program. DO NOT believe them. No matter what your issue is it will magically become something that they cannot come to your home to fix and you will have to send in just like ANY OTHER CHEAP warranty. There is NO premium service!!!
"I have a Lenovo Yoga 9i which I purchased not even a year ago and I have had persistent freezing issues where it will completely lock my computer. I attempted to get it fixed three times already and had the motherboard completely replaced to no avail. It still persistently freezes. Lenovo refuses to replace the laptop despite it being less than a year old. I would NOT recommend this product or company, especially if you are a student who can't afford time wise or financially to deal with this company. This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with a tech company."
"Their customer service and warranty department is horrible. They don't honor on site extended warranties and take months to complete repairs. They cancel tickets without a call back and argue with you on the phone about speaking with a manager. Our company has purchased many laptops, desktops, and servers from them all with extended warranties. Every time I have to call them for a repair I want to bang my head against a wall. We currently have a laptop out for service that has been in the repair 6 months out of the past year. I was promised a replacement last year when it was out at their service center for months and then magically the parts showed up at the last second and they sent it back saying repaired."
"This notebook is and has been driving me insane. I try to shut off stuff that causes grief, with no success, it constantly bogs down response with insufferable endless delays, the keyboard sucks because typical finger home position is lost with all keys flush flat, I absolutely HATE this notebook and its flaws!!! Full stop!"
"I bought ""IdeaPad.Slim 3 2021 Intel Core i3 11th Gen 14 inches FHD, LED IPS T&L Business, Laptop (8GB/256GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office/Backlit/Fingerprint Reader/Arctic Grey/1.41kg) 82H700J8IN"". From Day 1, Performance issues. For the last 5 and half months, I have been struggling with this. 2 times SW reinstallation done. Wasted 4 PD's only for making the changes. Extremely poor performance of the laptop. Horrible and Pathetic Customer support!"
"I purchased two laptops in 2021 from Lenovo. One was a ThinkPad T14 with top specs and an Idea Pad 5 with decent specs. I immediately hated the T14. It didn't do nearly as well with things as the Idea pad 5 despite the incredible specs in the T14 versus the idea pad. Eventually the T14 started overheating so bad, the fan often never coming on, that the fan started making a horrible unbearable noise. People couldn't sleep with it on and I couldn't have video chats or calls. Fortunately I put in a ticket right before the warranty expired but I have no faith it will be honored as the mail is delayed. We'll see. That said, if they don't fix it, it only becomes a matter of time before it becomes a brick. No laptop that costs more than $1000 (this was almost 1500 with a black friday sale) should become an overheated noisy brick within a year."
Got a Legion 5 Pro. One of the keys popped out right after unboxing. After times and times calling the customer support they sent someone over to fix it. The tech person was not even familiar with a laptop case. He “changed the keyboard” but now none of the fans work and the device heats up to 98 centigrade and the keyboard LED does not work.
My Lenovo C Series laptop of just over a year (just out of warranty) kept prompting me to do an update - I finally let it - it was some kind of BIOS update - it KILLED my laptop completely. Black screen - won't respond to anything. When I the went to Lenovo website - I cannot contact anyone because it is not in warranty - absolutely no way. I did get on the forum where I found out this is not a new problem - or one they have a remedy for. Despite having had it 15 months - I have less than 30 hours on the thing. Trash.
"I have a Legion T5-26AMR5 made by Lenovo. The other day I started having issues when I turned on the PC, bios was reporting a problem with the fan. I called support and immediately the technician said they were going to send me a flash drive so I can reinstall Windows 11. I said it is not a software but a hardware issue. It took 3 days of me trying to convince the ""technicians"" what the problem was. I even found the solution on one of Lenovo's own forum, ""replace the motherboard""."
"I bought a full coverage warranty from these clowns thinking if anything happens they would openly help replace or fix the issue. Now my laptop needs a new battery, and there are problems with my screen and all of which is fully covered by the warranty yet when I call them I spent an hour on the phone just on hold and then another hour trying to explain to the lady that I do not need another warranty because I already have one and I just need my laptop to get fixed. the lady kept pushing and pushing for me to buy something I already own! After all the hassle and time-wasting, nothing! THESE PEOPLE SUCK! THEY ARE NOT TRAINED TO HELP, JUST WASTE TIME AND MONEY!"
"Purchased idea pad 1 from Lenovo.com but was notified by a family member that there was a $75 price difference immediately after the purchase. I called customer service within the hour of purchase, received confirm# of cancellation. I placed new order, and instead chose an idea pad flex3; 2 days later both computers were shipped out. The website continually crashes during browsing, I should have taken that as an omen. The customer service guy told me to just take a picture of the price difference and when it comes provide them with the info. for the discount."
Sometimes I think I can throw the laptop from terrace but then. I get it very costly. I want replace it.. In lockdown I want to. I buy but now is hell..No review from my side. I wanted to zero review but no option for.. Lenovo.
"Bought IdeaPad 5 Pro in Jan 2022 (3 months ago at this point) directly from Lenovo's website, together with Premium Care support and 2 years accidental damage protection. 3 months later all of a sudden the wifi icon disappeared from the tray and the settings. I had to call on three separate occasions to Lenovo's Premium Care Support to ask them to open a repair ticket as they kept saying they would and send me a confirmation but didn't do it. On the third call, I said, ""Do not hang up until you have opened the ticket and sent me the confirmation,"" which is when they finally did it. Eventually they ordered a new wifi adapter card, which arrived the next day, the next day a technician came, changed the wifi adapter card, but it didn't help. Now they are planning to change the motherboard of my 3-month-old laptop!!! And they refuse to replace it."
"I called to get a price match on an offer that was currently on their website. I was told I had to take a screenshot of the offer and email it to them. Did that, then had it rejected because it was supposed to be ""in your basket at checkout"". The offer has since expired and I'm still trying to get them to honor the price as it was valid when I originally called in. This feels like I'm teaching algebra to pre-school students, however it's nowhere near that complex."
Junk is junk. Do not buy this brand of PC. Buy a used one with Windows 8. It will work better. Slowest pathetic useless computer on the market. I will not even donate this useless thing to charity. I can believe Best Buy sells this thing.
"Disaster!! Can't get any support! Email support but never gets an answer anywhere! Have so many awful problems with my P1 Gen4 so it's embarrassing! I now hate my brand new computer due to all the problems! Obvious quality problems, color missing on keyboard buttons, fans jerking, white spot on the screen, battery life max 4h, longer battery life on macbook 15 ""from 2011, bios updates that kill usb-c / TB4 ports, bluetooth problems, fan problems, sleep mode don't work properly (hot even though led is fading), usb-chime sounds al the time. Fresh windows 10 install with all drivers updated. Catastrophically Embarrassing!"
"When buying Lenovo products from their official website be aware that most likely you are not directly buying from Lenovo! No information during the process tells you that you are buying it from another seller as it happened in my case. My device is faulty and could not be repaired, so asked for refund directly Lenovo and they say they cannot tell me if I get refund or not. The seller needs to decide. And at that moment I was like, ""A seller?"" When you buy directly from Lenovo website you expect it to be from Lenovo directly. In my case it was Digital River. On top of this, they do not seem to be able to communicate to each other and make it easier for you. EMEA customer service recommended me to reach out also to Digital River. Why? The process is terrible and you as a consumer feel like wasting time talking to Lenovo. Never again. Be Aware!"
"I had planned shifting from HP to Lenovo, as I was about to purchase my second laptop but now I believe that this decision was the worst decision of my life. Currently, my laptop is under warranty (Please note I fall into Premium Customer Category), and my laptop's charger is not working, so have ordered a replacement via Premium Care Support expecting that they will resolve on priority as they mentioned ""Premium Care"". It has been now around 12 days since I ordered a replacement and every time they just ask me to wait and they continuously give some or the other reason to escape. I won't recommend using Lenovo laptops and would suggest to go for HP always."
"I've been using Lenovo's for 2 decades for work, great luck with their computers...but when I tried to order through them directly for a personal computer, had one of the worst experiences I've ever had in ordering online. They shipped the computer, but it got returned to the warehouse. Once I realized this and that I had been charged but never got the computer, it took me 2+ months to try and get them to first re-ship the computer and then finally just refund me the money for the computer I never got."
"Warning other consumers of Lenovo's horrible customer service re: faulty products. Purchased a brand new X1 Carbon, which has now crashed multiple times and been sent for repair (to no avail). They are doing everything possible not to issue a replacement/refund as they are obligated to under their warranty. Have been sent from one agent to the next, each passing the buck. They have no desire to try and solve your issue as a valued customer."
"Lenovo IdeaPad Laptop IS a great machine. In the event that something break down it become major headache with their customer service.... Be prepare for nightmare.... I called numerous time and needed to give all kind of information's such as address, tel #, etc. then was placed on long hold until the line was disconnected. And the same process repeat itself with the next call..."
"Lenovo ThinkCentre. They said it was fast. It is like going back to dial up. It is soooo slow, You have to wait for the picture to load. It freezes up. It makes noise constantly. I have to click on something 5 or 6 times before it reacts. What a piece of JUNK. I'm going to use it for target practice because that's all it's good for."
"I paid $2682 for a Lenovo Thinkpad in October 2019. The unit arrived defective. After I returned it, the sales rep, Brannon **, only authorized a partial refund of $2279.70, leaving a balance of $402.30 which they still owe me as of this writing on May 21, 2021. Phone calls, emails, supervisors, were not helpful. Lenovo is a deceitful company, cheating their customers and getting away with it if they can. I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND doing business with them. BUYER BEWARE! (This review will go viral.)"
"LENOVO HAS HORRIBLE SERVICE! Shipping standards are sub par, promises made and fell through. I needed my laptop a couple weeks ago when it was promised. Jaymar ** a supervisor of whom promised that, ""Once we have a label we will change the shipping."" He states that call never happened but it did between what seemed like hundreds of calls. This is affecting my livelihood now and I have and am losing money. I spent HOURS on the phone with Katapult, Lenovo, and UPS. (Yes I left Lenovo without a cap because their service is sub par.) The package was shipped yesterday and I was also told yesterday by Anderson ** with Lenovo that when the label is made he will contact UPS, up the shipping and email me with a confirmation. That hasn’t and probably won’t happened."
"One of the worst part of a technician job comes when we need to contact large corporations. Short story, we needed to purchase server warranty extension, believe it or not, we tried for 3 weeks with no luck. Support agents redirect us to a non-existent sales number, we scoured the internet to find Lenovo sales number, amazingly, none of them worked, either they were out of service, or the rand to some other business (nothing to do with Lenovo). I tried to contact the head quarter, good luck if you can! These guys are unreachable. It is quite baffling, I could understand support being swamped and not answering right away, but sales!! Anyhow, we will forget about replacing our Lenovo servers with other Lenovo, as this is impossible."
"I purchased a Legion Tower 7i computer from Lenovo in February 2021. On May 2nd, my computer completely stopped working and would only beep when restarted (Lenovo has beep codes to indicate different problems with the computer). I have a one-year warranty and the Ultimate Care Service agreement, so I contacted Lenovo and spoke with someone who not only didn't know about Lenovo’s beep codes but didn't even know what RAM memory or an HDMI cable was – I am NOT EXAGGERATING. He was reading out of a manual on how to troubleshoot problems, but obviously didn't know anything about computers. He stated that someone was going to come out the next day and fix my computer. Great!"
"I have a three year old Yoga Laptop. It need a new keyboard. Lenovo will not allow me to send it back to them, they say I must drop it off at Best Buy or similar. Best buy refused it, because they say they probably can't get parts. It is unclear why I can't send it to Lenovo. Would not recommend buying another laptop from them."
"This is my third Lenovo ThinkPad. The first Lenovo Thinkpad was over 10 years ago, it lasted about 5 years. I had a great experience that in returned I became a loyal customer, until now. I bought a new Thinkpad two years ago, and I was buying another one for my daughter. However this time I paid with two different credit cards, a debit card and a credit card. The balance was paid and I thought everything was fine until Lenovo charge half the cost once the CD Rom shipped out forcing my account to go overdraft because my checking account was balance with me maintaining $500."
Camera has never worked. I've taken it to 3-4 tech helps and no one can fix it. About 1/5 of the time I go to turn on the laptop it does not turn on no matter what I try. Laptop loads at the rate of a computer that has been dropped in the bathtub and filled with sand. Tech helpdesks always ask me how long I've had this laptop and they're always surprised when I say a year or two instead of 7 years. It has been slow and has failed to turn on since I first purchased it. Run as far away from this brand as possible. I wish I read reviews before I purchased it. I've failed exams because my laptop fails me so just stop looking at Lenovo right now.
The Lenovo Legion laptops apparently have a manufacturing defect that crashes the system when windows tries to update. Lenovo’s customer service does not have a solution when you call and just passes you around.
"I could try to describe how bad their service is, but you probably wouldn't believe me. My new laptop is less than 3 months old. The charging port stopped working, and I can't get it fixed. I've been on hold over 3 hours already with this company and haven't accomplished anything."
"Have been loyal to the brand for years, however, the sales process online or by direct sales is so bad it hard to understand. I own a mid-size company and started an order in January on 2021. Acquiring a couple of products to use in my Industry. With this intent to purchase 400 more to give my staff. It has been nothing less than a total failure! I think ordering direct from the business for products."
"Worked seemingly very well until it didn't. Unit died 2 wks post-warranty. Calls to Lenovo yield no support, advice or guidance, but an assurance that the warranty actually ended 5 mos. BEFORE the unit was even purchased. Suddenly would not power up, blinking light patterns on specific keys must be related to a diagnostic code which they will not even share. We followed all troubleshooting steps, took apart, replaced C-mos battery - nothing. But Lenovo is happy to charge me $85 + shipping to diagnose the problem. This was a big expense for us, and now our high schooler is out a computer and we are out the $. If you are comfortable budgeting $500/yr. then this is the computer for you. If not, then maybe not so much."
They emailed me with a cancelation notice with no explanation. I called the customer service number and they couldn’t tell me either. They offered to resubmit the order! No thanks. I’ll buy elsewhere!
"Do not purchase from Lenovo. I have always had Lenovo products however this last experience has put me off ever trusting this company again. Sadly, nothing to do with the product but solely down to the customer service. You're told a different story each time, and some emails I've received are bullying in nature. Basically, purchased desktop from UK site, paying VAT as is clearly itemised on the bill, only to find out it is shipped from Netherlands and I have import tax to pay to UPS. No mention of this on their website. I don't pay and speak to Lenovo to be told it is an error by UPS and they'll sort it, followed by (a week later) it is an error by UPS but if I just pay it they'll sort it and refund me!?"
"Four months after I bought my laptop, it stopped going into sleep mode or shutting down properly. I have poured hours into the situation with techs on the phone, had two techs come out to my house to replace parts, took the computer to Best Buy for service and still I am having the exact same issue. I am very disappointed in this company."
"I placed an order for an in-stock item (Nvidia 2080 Super) for $849 on February 15th. The item was to be delivered within 7-10 business days. I was browsing the web a bit after making the purchase and noted the price increase to $1049 only days after my order. I thought, thank goodness, I got to it in time. The due date for my delivery was set for March 4th. That date came and went... no delivery. After many attempts to call both sales and customer service, putting aside all the lies and wasted time, I finally was informed that there was simply a delay. So I wait... and wait and, you get the point... still no delivery."
"X1 yoga is a good machine, but the screens will start flickering and gets worse until you can't see anything. Here is the link to the issue and the reviews of all the angry customers who are annoyed: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-X-Series-Laptops/X1-Yoga-2nd-gen-Screen-problem/m-p/4101538. The customer service is terrible, I have been contacting them for month and they do not care about the issue at all. What hurts is that they know this is a factory issue and refrain from recalling the machines."
"I got a Brand New device from the manufacturer and the hardware in it broke in about 2 weeks. I attempted to contact customer service, and I got a speech bot that set a return call ""in 48 hours."" Two days later I got a text that determined that my broken hardware needed to come in for service and told me he'd sent an email as I was on my way to work. The next day I still didn't have an email and I called customer service back, the representative I spoke to couldn't manage to send me an email with instructions for my return that I should have received the day before due to ""difficulty with their email."" In my experience, their products are bad and their customer service is a farce."
"I have confirming documents of all the info below. On 10/5/2020, I ordered a Lenovo laptop (see confirmation email). It was $846.95 + $77.92 tax for a total of $924.87 (See Lenovo Order). On 11/28/2020, the price had decreased to $731.45 + $67.29 for a total of $798.74 (see screenshot of lower price). I called to Lenovo to cancel the first order and place a second order at the lower price, which they allow. The representative suggested that I instead submit for a price match (see Liwayway ** email). I immediately sent the price match request (see first price match request email)."
"Mass confusion between Lenovo and the finance company Katapult Bank, trying to resolve the issue of my refund, the amount of $280 I been calling both Lenovo and Katapult over this issue, how come I didn't get my refund, Katapult Finance keep telling they didn't get confirmation from Lenovo but Lenovo said they released the refund to katapult January 7th 2021 and it's completed, so stressful."
This is been the worst experience I've ever had with any company. I ordered a laptop and I was told it would be delivered in two to three business days three business. Not at all true. They continuously gave me the runaround. Never gave me a straight answer and if they did it was not the truth. I had to cancel my order with them which letter issues through somebody else I was going through as a creditor and long story short...I'm without a laptop and a refund. Be careful doing business with Lenovo!
"The laptop ran unbelievably slow, even after updating Windows and all drivers. It took upwards of 10 minutes to start up and took about 5 minutes to open any program, even just a simple browser. When I called technical support, they asked me to update Windows and the drivers (I already had done that). After that, they said I'd have to send the laptop in for repairs (a brand new laptop). When I tried to get a refund, they said it was past the 30 day policy (the laptop was purchased by my brother in November and given to me as a Christmas present - it was past the 30 days before I even opened it) and that I couldn't get a refund. I would not recommend this laptop, as it did not work as expected even brand new. Moreover, I wouldn't recommend any Lenovo products as their technical support and customer service is very difficult to work with. I did not feel like I was taken care of as a customer."
"Lenovo sales department took my info, then referred me to customer service. They then referred me to tech support. This is where the disappointment began. I like the laptop and it performs well. However after only 3 years my camera quit working. I paid $79 and $120 to have experts try and fix it. It comes down to a motherboard problem. A new motherboard is over $500. I tried to contact Lenovo tech support to talk to them about it but because it is out of warranty they would not even discuss it. They told me to go to Best Buy and have them look at it. This laptop is very well taken care of and is used for office work and not gaming. I require a camera for video meetings so I am left with using a separate camera. I have had other brands last much longer for far less money and work very well. I tried Lenovo but now have a decision- spend another $500 plus to have it fixed or cut my losses and go back to other brands. So disappointed in Lenovo."
"I purchased a Thinkpad 15 and customized it for Black Friday. Come late December, the wrong laptop was sent to me. I was initially told I would be sent the information for the return of the wrong item and a new order number ""in 24-48 hours"". 10 days later I had to contact Lenovo again because I still had no word. I was told that my ""case manager"" was reviewing my case and it was ""in the final stage of approval""; I would hear from the case manager the following week. Today I am told that my case was dropped because there was ""insufficient information"". I was never told of the decision or asked for information. Lenovo did not communicate at all- I had to keep contacting the customer service desk and collecting reference numbers. Unbelievable... I would have never thought that of a large company like that..."
"I bought a Lenovo Legion Y540 in June and I am not complaining about the product. However, my laptop was doing a Bluescreen every day due to a failure in the hard desk. I send it 5 times to Lenovo so that they could change it but the problem has never been fixed. Someone from the customer service even called me after the 3rd time I sent it and assure me it would be fixed after sending it another time. We are now in February, I don't have a working laptop. Very disappointed with a laptop that cost around 1000€."
"I bought a ThinkPad P53 in May 2020 and by mid-October part of the screen was randomly blacking out in spots. I sent it in for repair and was told I would have it back within 7-10 business days. After not hearing back for 2 weeks, or having my repair status updated, I called to find out they didn't know where my computer was or when I would get it back. I continued calling and requested a refund to buy a new computer but they refused. The laptop randomly showed back up at my house on December 15th despite being called the day before and told that my laptop was missing. Unfortunately, the problem wasn't fixed as they could recreate it. Back to calling, waiting, and being bounced around to different departments. I was told that I would be able to get a refund until sent to another department who said it wasn't possible but said they'd have a technician call to help me fix it over the phone."
"My Lenovo laptop computer is under warranty. The internal power source in my laptop was faulty. I spent over one hour on the telephone and finally was told that I had to send my laptop to Texas. I need it for work and they said they would send an email immediately with a form to fill out and pre-paid UPS. Then I could ship it to them the same day. It NEVER arrived. I had to wait several more days. Then It took two weeks before I got the PC back. Within one week, the computer was DEAD AGAIN. I spent close to two hours and spoke to four different people. I was cut off twice. One technician said that the same problem would have to recur four times for them to replace my computer. I will NEVER BUY A LENOVO!"
"I bought a Lenovo Thinkpad 3 Years ago. The speakers are a tinny joke. The plastic body is so thin it is literally falling apart! I can't even close the lid anymore because it is cracked where the hinges are. The key board is cracking down the middle and I now have no choice but to buy a new one. Shame on Lenovo for even thinking this product is worth selling! Shame on me for buying a cheap computer, I got less than what I paid for!"
"In June of 2020 I paid $1,808.94 for a Thinkpad P52. Just a few days past their 30 return policy, I called them because the computer would shut down with a VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE notice every time I would run Adobe software. They told me I could not return since it was a few days past the return period. So, I spent hours on the phone with them, replacing the hard drive, reinstalling Windows, rebooting. Looking for problems. I became an IT person overnight."
"This Lenovo laptop last more than 5 years but the card reader and dvd drive were the first to not work any more. Then the other peripherals or IO devices. Right now, the motherboard and cpu is still working. The video card installed on the mother board is working if you do not play graphics game likes heroes might and magic V which requires intensive graphics. It will overheat the graphic card installed which will result to no display or crash the system. The usb drive somethings works and sometimes do not work. You have try many times."
"I have a Lenovo Ideapad. This is a great laptop. Great ergonomics, lightweight, great sound and fast. The touchpad is very good. I use it all the time as it is responsive and I don't need a mouse. I really love it."
"I bought Lenovo Legion Y540 in Jan 1st, 2020 and within 9 months it started giving me blue screen problem (i.e. Critical process died). I update operating system, updated all drivers as well as BIOS. Due to Covid 19, I was not able to leave my laptop. So, waited till December when my job is not much hectic. I schedule the repair from November last week and now it's Dec 24th. Till now, these disgusting customer service people are not helping me. They first send me to Best Buy for repair. I told them I did not buy laptop from best buy. I bought from Amazon and will Best buy help me in repair. Then the lady told me that they have partnership with Best buy and they will help. I went to Best buy and as expected they did not help me as I did not buy there."
"I have only used Lenovo at my current employer, and I must say, the quality and reliability of these laptops is horrible. I've worked with HP, Mac and Dell at previous employers, and I have never had the issues (and not just me, but our entire organization complains about the equipment) that I have had with Lenovo products. For example, this year (2020) alone, I have had my laptop swapped out 3 times for different hardware issues--monitor blew out, keyboard stopped responding and charging port died."
I always bought Toshiba laptops but this time I bought a Lenovo and am very pleased with its performance. It was simple to set up and gives just what I need in a laptop. Would recommend this brand to anyone.
I just tried to get a question answered. Done everything on the web site I was asked to do. Even downloaded the app from play store. They say device not found. I gave serial number right off my device. Long to short I got no help after wasting 2 hrs. On trying to get an answer. So I'm unplugging my Lenovo device. I'll never purchase another one. Thanks for nothing. My purchase was at Best Buy in Murfreesboro TN. In September.
"Bought this for myself. The mousepad/cursor malfunction right out of the box. It highlights whatever it wants. As someone with a multi-disciplinary education, who also used to program for the military--it's a no from me. Got it from Best Buy. I had heard great things about Lenovo. Such a workhorse. Such a great overall solid computer. Solid piece of garbage. Would randomly open anything the cursor was near. Took it to Geek Squad and an independent computer repair at high prices. Both said it is defective. Randomly opens ads. Randomly highlights words on a screen."
"I ordered a Lenovo Active Pen 2 for Yoga 11/30 as a Christmas present. Lenovo created a shipping label and charged us on 12/3, with an ETA of 12/10. By 12/14, it was still listed as ""in transit to UPS."" Four days later and all I can get from customer service is, ""we're looking into it"" and ""be patient - it will arrive soon."" They will not tell me what has happened, why it has taken 14 days (so far) to get my package to a UPS facility, and when (if) the package will ship. They won't let me cancel the order or redirect the shipping destination to my grandson because they say ""it has shipped."""
"Our company bought this computer three months ago. It consistently lags when turning the actual desktop on, clicking on anything in the taskbar, using any major Microsoft/Adobe downloads, and doing anything overall that you would need to do for a business. Customer service is entirely absent. Do not recommend for trying to do anything remotely important."
"First, the positives. Lenovo makes attractive products at decent price points. That's where the good news ends. Reliability is sketchy, and customer service is absolutely horrible. I have owned three Lenovo laptops, a Thinkpad and two Yogas (920 and C940). All of the laptops have required repairs (under warranty, within first year of ownership). My experience with my Yoga 920 (since replaced at Lenovo's expense by a Yoga C940) have been shockingly bad. The 920 required three motherboard replacements due to persistent issues with the touchpad consistently failing. Finally, after the 3rd replacement failed, Lenovo admitted that it was a design issue and shipped me a replacement Yoga C940. After 4 months with the new Yoga C940, it bricked overnight as a result of Bitlocker issues following a Windows 10 monthly update (Oct 2020 update)."
"On November 27, 2020, I purchased a Lenovo laptop from Office Depot. The laptop is great and I have had no issues with it. Problems started when I attempted to register the laptop with Lenovo so it could be covered under their 1 year warranty policy. When I attempted to complete the registration online, the system responded with a message that it was out of date. I found the validation date was May 2020, and I could not receive the benefit of a full 12 months. That must have been the date of purchase of Lenovo. I had to file a ticket with Lenovo and wait almost 10 days. They required me to submit documentation of purchase. Another 5 days of waiting and they finally changed it to the correct date of purchase."
Lenovo is accepted as one of the best PC manufacturers in the world. I was thinking the same until I decided to purchase one. They have fairly nice web site as a front but in the background it is worst than a rigged slot machine. Here is the problem. If you make a mistake with your order and would like to cancel this order you proceed with the web page it gives you the ability. You then receive an email (please see attached). You think the order is cancelled. NO. Now your pain starts. You see that they first get authorization from your card. If you are like me you seek ways. The only way is phone call. It took me the first day three hours to reach a live person. Of course out of USA. The was kind but as helpless as I was. He kept telling me it was cancelled manually and it takes 48 hours.
"I ordered a Lenovo tablet on Dec. 2nd the website said it would ship on Dec. 4th and arrive Dec. 8th. I was informed I would receive an email with tracking information once the item shipped. On Dec 7th I called to find out why I had not received tracking information. I was told my hold time would be more than 2 hours (are you kidding me?). I hung up and opted for chat which showed I was number 19 in the queue. After 20 minutes I was connected and informed my order would ship the next day, Dec 8th."
"Lenovo advertises a 5% discount if you sign up as a business customer, so I did. When I logged in and selected a laptop, the price had no discount. The products may be ok, but I am struggling to understand how they can get away with it? A call to the customer service line elicited a B/S response about the pricing being US and Canadian but no ability of the rep to offer a 5% discount. Seems like the typical bait & switch approach to online marketing. Anyway, I bought a Dell instead. Same specs at a better price with or without the discount!"
"Astonished by the level of cheap customer service I have received from Lenovo. The support reply back norm is 24-48 hours, i emailed them regarding the order 4 times in 27 days, and finally received a reply stating sorry we are busy, and brushed me off saying you will get your shipment when you get it. Called them, every agent had a different story, even after giving them the order number that was canceled a couple of days ago, 2 of the agents kept on saying the order is not canceled, other two said its canceled. Mind-boggling customer experience, never buying from them again."
"I have an Lenovo Ideapad S340 that I shipped to Lenovo support to fix an in-built microphone issue. 40 days and several frustrating calls later, still no status on my laptop. Stay away from this scam."
"I bought a Lenovo Yoga laptop. Only a month and a half in, the laptop stopped working and would never turn on despite being fully charged. I was unable to resolve this on my own and called customer service, where a woman instructed me over the phone but failed to fix the laptop. She said a more experienced staff member would call me in ""24-36 hours"". I was at work and missed his call by a minute, and even though I called Lenovo immediately, they closed my case and marked the issue as ""resolved"" even though we never fixed the issue."
"I purchased one of their top-of-the-line idea pad and it stopped working within a year. Luckily it is still under warranty so I sent it in for repair. After a month in service Lenovo service sent it back to me. I was excited and happy to get it back but it was short lived. The laptop worked for 20 minutes and then crashed and wouldn't boot. The same symptoms for sending it in for repair the first time. I sent it in again right away and have not heard back from Lenovo. It's been almost 3 months now and every time I call for an update they come up with an excuse like, ""No worries we'll put it as top priority and you should get it back shortly"", or, ""Our computer system crashed and we can not access your repair order."" It's speaks volumes when a computer companies computers are down and they can help their customers because of it!!"
"I keep getting the run around about my order. My order was placed on the 28th of November with an expected shipping date of the 29th. Then the expected shipping date changed to December 2nd and now it says the 4th. Well, today is the 5th of December with an expected shipping date of the 4th still showing. Also, the people I've spoken with when I call to find out what was going on are very rude and with an attitude and offered to connect me to UPS for an order that hasn't even shipped yet as a resolution... ""Because that's all they can do"" according to the idiot who was in charge of customer support. Way to go Lenovo, you've managed to score a whopping 1 star review on the BBB from all the excellent customer service you provide. Terrible, absolutely horrible customer experience and I will never do business with Lenovo again."
Since the beginning I've had blue screen issues with this computer and your tech support sucks. The end of this month will be a year I've had this PC. Now my settings screen won't pull up and my PC won't do a factory reset. I'm suppose to receive a recovery media USB and an email this week that never happened. I did a follow up call only to discover that my work order was never submitted and that my address was not on file and email address was incorrect. You will definitely have to fish through the agents to get one that knows what they are doing. DEFINITELY WILL NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING LENOVO AGAIN.
"I am a long-time customer of Lenovo laptops; always liked them, so I stayed loyal. My newest one is the most expensive Lenovo I have ever bought - but it has build issues, and the company refuses to help me. The build quality issues we are encountering should not happen with a new laptop - yet Lenovo won't fix the problems, under warranty. We are not happy with Lenovo, and will not buy this brand again. Look around at other laptops before you decided, and read reviews - there are a lot of good ones out there! And with good support, too."
I ordered a desk top computer that I despite need for work when my laptop tore up. It said 3 to 5 days to ship. It's been two weeks now and my shipping date has changed 5 different times and keeps going to later dates to ship. When it gets close to shipping date it will change again. I am beginning to think that I am never gonna receive it and I am ready to request a refund. Don't ever order from the direct company online or you will never get your merchandise!! I have called the company and never got a straight anwser to why my order keeps getting delayed. I am beginning to think it's a scam!!
"3 month old Laptop and the camera goes out. Sent in because I was told 9 days and it will be back. Now Laughable. Countless calls and many hours on hold. Live help no idea what is going on and can't answer simple questions even with documented paperwork and a repair order number. Online chat no better. Still don't have a clue of what is going on and someone will always call me back in 24-48 hours. At least 4 times and still no call. Website does not update my repair. This company has to be a scam and the Chinese are getting back to us for the trade issues. IBM should be really proud that they sold their computer division to Lenovo. This indeed reflects on IBM too, In My Humble Opinion!"
"Where to start... I had to replace like 5 new ideapads before getting one that had a functioning bios. Later it had a battery problem. Then I returned that and bought a T590. Hibernation didn't work, but rather went into sleep mode. I called support and they told me to run all sorts of tests. Everything passed, so they told me to contact the software support. Guess what, software support wasn't covered in my warranty. So basically I have to pay extra to fix a problem that came with a brand new laptop. Pathetic."
"Extremely disappointed with this company. Not 6 month into my new purchase of my Lenovo Yoga 730 I noticed that the screen popped out of the frame at the right side hinge. I contacted 5-6 time to try and resolve with zero resolve. Their customer service does not follow up, their escalated ticket process does not follow up. The screen is now cracked and the touch screen does not work. They are now telling me my warranty will not cover it and I am on the hook to fix. I am getting nowhere with this company."
"This company is a complete scam. I ordered for an item and they said they would deliver it on a specific day but they never did. They later sent me an email claiming that they had delivered it not on the specified date, but prior to the specified date! I have called them three times now to get it sorted and get a refund but they have refused to sort it out. They keep telling me that they will sort it out yet nothing happens. This company is a sham and this is the first and last time I will ever order anything from Lenovo. Maybe that's what I get from patronizing a Chinese business."
I ordered a ThinkCentre M70q Tiny desktop computer via the Lenovo online store 10/21/2020. The package was lost in shipping (UPS). I reported the error to Lenovo via telephone on 10/31/2020 (the online customer support system was offline). Since then I have received NO update. The online customer support system is still offline and no one will answer the customer service telephone line. Last time I called I was left on hold for 36 minutes at which time the call was abruptly terminated from their end. Meanwhile credit card has been charged for the full amount.
"I love the laptop but not the after sales support. The laptop has great performance, functionally and has everything I wanted. I like the slimmer design and weight compared to my older models. It is super fast with good 16mg of ram and 500gb SSD drive. However, the after sales support was a terrible experience. I had a problem activating the Microsoft Office that I purchased pre-loaded from Lenovo. I spent 5 hours on the phone and online with different Lenovo departments without ever getting it resolved. I gave up and eventually resolved the problem with Microsoft's help. This is my seventh ThinkPad laptop and have never experienced such terrible support. I am writing the review here because Lenovo refused to add my review on their website. The Thinkpad gets 5 stars the support zero stars."
"Bought brand new Yoga C740 laptop directly from Lenovo's website. I paid for the three years of premium customer support. After two months the keyboard stopped functioning, onsite technician came to repair the laptop (replace keyboard), and it turns out another two parts (motherboard and Camera) are also bad. I requested Lenovo premium care, to replace the whole laptop as it is only three months old and I do not want a Frankenstein laptop with parts all swapped out. Premium care refused to honor my request, saying that after the next repair, they will escalate but will not promise any replacement."
"Don't ever buy from Lenovo! I bought a computer 3 months ago. It was delivered while I was out of town and was returned. When I notified Lenovo they told me they would resend it. I called every week for 2 months, was given the ""personal work email"" of 4 ""customer service reps"" and have never heard anything or been served. For the past month I have asked for a refund every week and continue to be told they are ""working on it"". -0 in service, 0 in honesty. Worst experience and dishonest company I have tried to give business to."
I purchased a Thinkvision X1 Gen2 4k monitor from Lenovo.com. The order took over two weeks to arrive. It was DOA. I started a customer support incident which took over a week to resolve. I submitted evidence but they took over a week to approve a replacement unit. The unit took 2 weeks to arrive. The new unit worked for 2 months and then developed banding on the screen making it unusable. I started a support ticket. Its been a month and 2 of my support tickets have been closed in error. I have opened a 3rd support ticket with them. I'm out over $500 and I still do not have a working monitor. I may end up having to buy another product. I recommend you to stay away from this company due to its poor support and inability to grantee a working product.
"I purchased this product just 1 year back and its hard disk crashed twice. I took it to service center and they repaired it. However, within a month again Hard disk crashed and laptop is not starting. Now in this covid situation they closed all service centers and helpline numbers. I have raised a service ticket through email, but I have been waiting since last three months to get an answer. I am so much frustrated with this product. Such a bad experience with product and Lenovo service. I must say they have degraded their brand value in recent year and selling typical cheap Chinese products. I claim replacement of this laptop but that also they are not considering. Had it been US or UK they would have easily replaced such faulty products but in India they know how to cheat people."
This product has a known issue of the hard drive crashing. Call customer service and received no follow. After two more calls they asked me to send it back. They replaced the hard drive. It came back with low memory. They asked me to send it back again. I received it back and they did not address the issue. My personal IT person check it and advised they replaced the hard drive with one that has smaller memory. The laptop now acts like a Chromebook and it can only be used if you attach an external hard drive. I still have not gotten a call back. They keep texting me via Twitter asking to complete step and and send pictures as if I’m supposed to be tech support.
"You know that saying, before you get married to someone, have them use a slow computer to find out who they really are. Lenovo computers would be perfect for this. After 3 different Lenovos, I know it’s not just me. No matter if I only have two tabs open, or even if I’m just trying to use a word document on my desktop, slow, constantly crashing or booting me off. The mouse pad and microphone have completely stopped working and they wouldn’t fix it even with a warranty. The one I have now has one of the highest processing speeds supposedly and is less than two years old. I’m currently writing this as I’m waiting for chrome to open. If you get one, it’ll be a great practice of your patience!"
"A company, the likes of Lenovo should be embarrassed by the quality of their Customer Service and Tech teams. I am a new owner of a Yoga C940 which seems to be fantastic so far but OMG what it took to get there was ridiculous. If after a week of owning my new 2 in 1, I could have backed out of the purchase simply due to the piss poor customer service I received I would have. This will happen to you. You will feel helpless with your issues. Be diligent and get angry. The only way I was ever able to resolve my issue was to make a huge scene and finally get through to the ONLY person that could help me (that I was told ""didn't exist). My issue was resolved in less than 30 seconds once I got past the customer service idiots. It's not easy but you can do it! Here's hoping the product is not a reflection of the service."
I purchased and used a Lenovo Ideapad for 40 days when it quit working. I contacted them and they had me send it in. They have had it for 23 days and they never contact me and every time I call we go through the same thing and no one knows exactly what the wait is about but some case manager will contact me within 24 to 48 hours. I have heard this weekly three times now and so far nothing has been done.
"The computer had problems a few months out of the box. It takes an act of congress to get assistance and when you do, each rep has a different answer. After ""hours"" spent on the phone and frustrated with the entire ORDEAL each time, Lenovo did extend (gratis) my warranty to another 6 mos. for my trouble. Cutting to the chase, the laptop continued to have issues and it was suggested I purchase a 3 yr. premium warranty which I did. Moving along the computer is still a problem and after too many phone calls I would learn that my 3yr. extended warranty was cut short by 6 mos. I bought the add'l warranty 12/2/19 and 3 years later would mean 12/2/22. (Grade school taught me that 3 years = 36 months.)"
Pathetic front desk executive. No Mask. The guy was rude and arrogant. Not willing to help and was ready to fight. That is the service you get when you buy a Lenovo product. Lenovo exclusive showroom Orange County Indirapuram
I buy a battery from ShopClue. Don't purchase anything from this site. Battery didn't work then I call to battery Lenovo customer care then they told me this product is stop manufacturing before 2 yrs. I lost my Rs 2000/- if they stop manufacturing so what... What I do... They are saying... Where are you purchase go there... Seller will give you money back..
I'd purchased Lenovo Ideapad 330(AMD Ryzen 5 2500U) for my father from Flipkart and I really liked overall build quality even though it's plastic. It worked fine for the first 4 months and then battery had issue but as it was with my father. He didn't care about it. During lockdown I got to know about this and contacted Lenovo Support. They are very good in talking but not at all in solving/helping. For the past two months they've been making us do same steps over and over without sending any technician for help and we've to do all the diagnostics and technical steps ourselves. When I started contacting them we had 2 months of Warranty and now we've only 2 days of Warranty till 15th July 2020.
"I ordered a laptop on the 1st of July because it had a 1-2 days shipping note, and I am in need of a laptop for work. I didn't receive an email to confirm it was shipped until the 7th, and it had NO tracking number mentioning NOW that there might be a delay on delivery once you ship it off ""1-3 days"". This is very misleading, it's one thing to inform their customers that the supply chain has been affected by the pandemic and they're aiming to get items delivered within 'X' amount of days BEFORE they make their order, as they would know from the forefront what to expect, it's completely different to display on your website that an item will ship within 1-2 days only to ship it 4 days later and NOT provide any tracking details, so you won't even know when the item will even be delivered. This is very wrong, they should be honest as to whether they're being affected by the whole situation and inform the customers of what to expect."
"The Yoga 3 Pro has a major defect as well as Lenovo customer service. I purchase this laptop April 2019 along (fortunately) with a 3 year in-house service agreement. Was only able to use the laptop for 3-4 weeks and got an internet adapter error message and wasn't able to get on the internet. After multitude of calls to Lenovo and a month later they had someone come in to service the laptop. It worked for 3 days. Again, many calls and 4 months later they finally delivered a new laptop. The new laptop, same model Yoga c930 Glass, worked for 2 weeks and got the same error messages. I have 3 other laptops in the house (one I frequently use) that have no problem with the internet adapter so it's not something I'm doing that is causing this problem."
"I had chosen Lenovo after looking up ratings of different laptop brands. I then purchased a Lenovo IdeaPad 360 i5, 1tb HDD which simply continued to disappoint. I should have sent it back a few months after purchase when the first problem started, it kept freezing when I turned it on. Shortly after this the laptop picked and chose when it wanted the sound to work, what I mean is that when I turned it on on most occasions the sound wouldn't work. Now I'm two years down the line with a laptop that takes forever to start up and I wait ages for a simple program like word to open up. Nor does the laptop physically close properly, whenever I close it there is a gap between the bottom and screen on the right hand side. I'm extremely disappointed."
I purchased a Yoga laptop from BestBuy and the fan broke only month later. The computer started overheating and freezing so I sent it in for repairs to the warranty department at Lenovo. They had it for a month and when they finally returned it to me it arrived with a crushed corner and messed up screen. I called them back and after several hours on hold and talking to multiple people they figured out how to send me a shipping label so I could send it back. I send it off and to my surprise I received it back two weeks later in the same condition: still broken! They didn’t do ANYTHING to fix it but sent me a notification that the repair was complete and mailed it back to me. This has been absolutely maddening and unbelievable. Worst customer service EVER! What a JOKE! I am beyond upset that I wasted my money on this product!
"When trying to purchase a laptop on Lenovo’s website, it continually malfunctioned. After entering my name, address and payment info, I simply couldn’t check out, the system repeatedly timed out or a pop up box emerged that said my cart was empty (it was not). I had no option but to use the chat service for assistance- both sales and customer service were rude and untrained. Due to the website’s malfunction I was not able to create an account an earn the rewards I was due for this purchase. I was told there was no way to resolve this without cancelling my order and placing it again- there was no way I was going to do this because I already wasted an hour of my time just trying to check out in the first place. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, I was mysteriously disconnected."
"Terrible experience with Lenovo. We were purchasing a new laptop for our son as he just graduated from high school and heading to college. The system we chose was “highly rated” and “in stock” and “shipping next day”. However we quickly found none of this was true. After no activity seen on the tracking number after 2 days, I called and they said there was an unexpected delay but would ship shortly. 2 days later, received a note that “the model is on back order” and “we are not sure it will ship”. Seriously, it’s either in stock or it’s not.. To make matters worse, we’ve been dealing with them for the last 2 weeks in them offering a compatible substitute. The system they offered was NOT comparable and in fact a cheaper model."
"So far no problems after five years of use. Wish it had more USB ports and more slots for use such as SanDisk. All together, however, this has been a satisfactory piece of equipment that has run smoothly."
I bought a Lenovo Chromebook for my granddaughters to do their school on. I love it. Very durable and lightweight. It is also easy to use. The price is very affordable and great customer service. I researched all brands of Chromebooks and I am very glad I went with Lenovo.
Lenovo makes affordable and great laptops. There are many models to choose from for different needs. They also had a great solid state laptop I ended up purchasing. For the kids they had light weight machines.
Fast on the internet. It is reliable. The computer is lightweight and very easy to navigate. I love the design. The screen is beautiful. Nice colors. Easy to get things done on good hard drive. The price is good for the computer. Also not too expensive.
"The Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 15 is a nice product but the battery is inadequate to serve off plug for more than a couple of hours w/o needing add'l charging. You have to purchase the more expensive YOGA to get a solid battery. Only other concern - I have the 3 year onsite warranty. They were to ""send someone to assess why the camera is not functioning"". They never did. Then the came covid and the laptop stopped booting so now it is all on me to get them the laptop and wait.... Concerned I'll be w/o it for quite sometime. We will see. I love my Lenovo ThinkCentre desktop."
"I have a Lenovo t450s and have had it since 2014 - it has been great - gets the job done and has been very efficient. I am in the process of upgrading it now, mainly because I do lots of photography and felt the need for a newer, more robust system was needed, but I ould highly recommend a Lenovo to anyone. I am now retired, but when I was working, the laptop provide at work was also Lenovo and it was great. Performs well - holds up well - easy to update and use."
"The PC I received originally was a gift for Christmas, however it wasn't working properly so I had to ship it back to my sister who had to pursue getting another one sent out via Staples. Luckily the second one I received was working appropriately however after having it for 4 months the charging cord broke and had to be replaced, luckily thru Lenovo warranty instead of Staples. If I had to go back to Staples I would have simply purchased a new charging cord, as Staples was not very easy to work with."
I have had the computer several years and it seems to be working right now. There are days that sometimes I have to reboot or shut it down if there is something wrong with it and the computer technology is always changing and just hope that it works out well.
"Lenovo All-in-One with Touch Screen. I enjoy the versatility of this unit. On occasion, unit is slow to respond but, I believe, this is due to my satellite service. I live out in the country and have access to only satellite service. The screen is an excellent size, touch option is helpful, adjustments to font size are very simple. I’ve had upwards of six screens open at a time and the time to process does not slow."
"The laptop was a low price. Advertised with Avast hard drive, but that was not the case. The computer also came with MS to be installed. Well, once the computer was updated the programming took up all of the space on the hard drive and it could barely run after. I could not even install MS word, etc that came with the computer. The company refused to take it back and left it to sit around in my office."
Bought a Lenovo desktop computer for the covid-19 virus. I figured I would be home a lot. This was the last model Best Buy had because everything was sold out. I wasn't that familiar with Lenovo but now I love this brand. I have been using the Lenovo computer day and night for the last 6 weeks and so far I have not had a single problem. I would highly recommend it.
This is my second Lenovo and it's a great laptop for home or traveling. I'm an amateur photographer and it quickly uploads my photos plus it has easy photo enhancements to apply. It does not come with an SD card slot though so I purchased a Lenovo card reader.
We own Lenovo laptops but have never purchased one from Lenovo directly until now. Aside from the sales experience which was excellent we have some of the worst customer service and technical support we have ever experienced. And the problem as of now still hasn't been resolved. We purchased a Yoga 730 for our daughter for school and activities. The machine arrived with a problem with the volume and sound quality of the video chat feature. We contacted customer service and after dealing with a difficult phone system were connected overseas to a gentleman who was almost impossible to understand. After 5 attempts to give him the serial number he put us on hold and after about 10 minutes came back to tell us that we needed a technical person but none would be available for 2 days.
"I find the reliability of the Lenovo to be one of the best on the market today. Searching the web such as using Wikipedia, the Encyclopedia and the dictionary making sure words are spelled right. I do a lot of my Bible studies on my Lenovo as well. I listen to youtube videos to get updates on what our government is doing for the American people. Product recalls that affect consumers buying. Keeping up with the coronavirus updates and naturally the stimulus money."
"Excellent, reliable, perfect viewing, lighted keypad, and powerful rapid processor. Laptop - Lenovo Yoga. It is the perfect travel computer - lightweight, easily fits into my carry-on's laptop section including the padded case."
I purchased this refurbished so it doesn't have the original battery since I guess they had some problems with them. I hate Windows & have an Android phone so hardly ever use this anymore. At least I was able to install Windows 10 on it so hopefully that was an improvement.
"My Thinkpad from Lenovo is so reliable, I only require it for bits and pieces-but I have not had a single issue since I bought it 5 years ago. I did have a Mac before that, but I’m only really used to Windows, so I ended up not using many of the functions, a non tech like me... I just need it to print documents, Social media, news, movies and documentaries."
This laptop I just bought from Lenovo is awful. I sent it back. It wouldn't hook up with the Web and it just kept dropping off. Jumping around doing its own thing. The cursor moved around. The pages changed. It was possessed. If they told me I could have it for free I would give it away.
"I purchased a Lenovo Idea Center All in One desk top computer in February of 2019. Late February of this year, just after the warranty expired, the computer ceased working. The screen went dark. When I took it in for repair, the mother board was clearly scorched. According to the certified repair shop, it is definitely the fault of the manufacturer. After multiple agonizing phone calls with customer service, they will do nothing, since the computer is out of warranty. The purchase price of the machine was about $700. Do not buy from this company. Very poor quality and zero help with the problem."
Under no circumstances should you buy a Lenovo product. In my 35 years in business I have never experienced a totally useless customer service department. It is basically nonexistent. No one does anything... They take your info. say they are going to call back and nothing. Computer failed 3 times within 1 year and they just play with you on the phone saying they will do something to no avail.... STAY AWAY FROM LENOVO.... What a waste of hours on the phone.... USELESS CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT!
"Yoga X1, high end Ultra Laptop. Bought because of previous experience with Lenovo. Consistent problems that Lenovo are unable to rectify to date. Has had system board replaced and unit has been replaced once each. Fingerprint reader fails nearly every time. Outlook loses sync every time kid is closed requiring a re-sync or full restart of the app. Lenovo want me to do a re-build back to way machine was shipped now (haven't done due to Pandemic, in case support was not available). Did offer to refund money if I was willing to accept a 15% charge based on selling price, can't afford that on a new top of the line PC. Paid for a extended 2 year warranty, so I guess I will just have to keep going back to Lenovo to see if they can fix it. Would not recommend a Lenovo product or buying thru the internet, buy from a brick and mortar store. Apple phones and iPads we have are all rock solid."
"I got this 2013 laptop six years ago when it was on super sale at Staples. It has traveled to China and has been a workhorse for me ever since. All of its then whiz bang tech is now obsolete but, with regular updates and virus protection, this machine has somehow survived and is still trucking. I bought a new laptop three years ago because I was afraid this one might not work for much longer but I have been proven wrong!"
"I’ve used my Lenovo “all in one”, daily for 5 years. I am a professor in an online master’s program, and spend several hours each day communicating with students, preparing lessons, and grading papers, online. I also operate an eBay business which requires weekly online upkeep. My Lenovo has all the advanced features needed to keep up with my advanced technology needs, and it has always been reliable. I highly recommend it!"
My wife and I run a small business. We do work from home 40% of the time. We have two Lenovos - one at our place of business and one at our home. They are set up as mirror image. We bought these two lenovos in 2013. We have not one bit of trouble with either one. If and when another laptop is needed I would likely buy another lenovo.
"Lenovo make a pretty good laptop. Usually has long battery life and good performance. They do tend to be a little heavier than some others, but they do seem to work and hold up pretty well. I like the larger keyboards and the screens usually have good color to them."
I have the Ideapad Flex 4. I have had been the device since 2016 (4 years now) and it is still working as expected. The device is reliable and processing speed is adequate for what I need it to do. I really like the capability and how easy it is to convert to tablet mode and back to laptop mode.
"Outstanding performance, and excellent customer service! Highly recommended! Always used HP computers, but my service tech convinced me to go with the Lenovo brand. Now I know. No one can go wrong with an IBM Computer..."
"My five month old Lenovo S145 Ideapad failed to boot up. Warranty support ""booked"" return calls and never called as promised. From online forums I got error codes indicating it didn't detect the hard drive. After many calls over several days, I sent it to the manufacture for repair, got it back with documentation indicating they replaced the hard drive and reloaded the OS. Out of the box it boots but now the wireless doesn't work and it doesn't detect a wireless adapter. I started the process over, booking return calls from hardware support and they again haven't returned them despite promises to return calls within 24 hours."
"Do not buy from Lenovo!! Zero customer service!! I ordered a computer and missed adding the $100 off coupon, tried to apply it after the fact only to be told to cancel my order and try again. I cancelled on the advice of the cs team. While trying to re-order I was informed that the $100 off coupon was a lie and was actually 5% off and was already applied to the order I cancelled and there was no need for me to cancel. Now it's been 96 hours and still no refund from the cancelled order. They said 24-48 hours and it's been 96 hours....Still waiting for my refund and I will not be buying anything from these **."
What's good:
"I bought a laptop directly from Lenovo in 2018. In 2019 I started having battery issues but magically it's was just out of their warranty period. So I eventually figured it out myself and bought another. One year later I am having issues with booting, and still Lenovo won't help due to warranty having expired. I'm frankly frustrated with this complete disregard for customer service. I paid $1,700 for this laptop and it seems like it's lasting for 2 years only. I will definitely not be buying another Lenovo."
"I bought a Lenovo All-in-One computer in October 2019, the sound was damaged in May 2020; Since I had paid a ""Premium Care Onsite Support"" guarantee, call for service at home. It turned out that they do not have the service at home, they wrote that they would send what was necessary so that the computer could be sent to fix them. That they paid the expenses. Now it turns out that I must pay the shipping because they do not pay. I think that the computer is crap and the guarantee is a robbery-deception."
"Lenovo Ideapad 330. One of the worst laptop and worst customer service from Lenovo team. My new Lenovo Laptop works slower than my 14 year old Dell laptop. Alex ** Head of Customer Relations has never bothered to respond to a single email, even after I have emailed him several times. So please think twice before buying Lenovo Product. As Customer Service is very poor and as usual they will tell you that Laptop is working fine, there are no issues."
I had a laptop ordered on my card and contacted them immediately. Chatted with a representative who said the order would not ship but within 25 mins I got a UPS tracking number. I attempted to cancel the order and they denied the cancelation even though I notified them it was a fraudulent order. The next day I spent 90 mins on the phone and chat attempting to get the order stopped before shipment which was successful and asked when the hold would be taken off my card to get my money back. They said next business day which was a lie. 3 business days later order was canceled they assured me and today the charge on my card was taken out and they told me today I'd have to wait 7 to 10 business days for a refund. DON'T SUPPORT THEM. THEY HOLD YOUR MONEY.
"Hello, With lots of disappointment and bitterness, I would like to inform you that I had the worst experience in my life with Lenovo Canada laptops! I received 2 laptops (ThinkPad X1 Extreme 2nd gen.) in a row (the second as a replacement) that apparently suffered manufacturer's defects, and it seems likely that they were refurbished. I am sorry to say it, but I lost trust in Lenovo."
"I have the Lenovo 720. Three months after I bought it the touch screen stopped working. I attempted to get assistance with the company and they gave me the runaround. Either it was not the right department or the wrong person. This continued until I was no longer under warranty and now I have to either pay someone more than this computer is worth to fix it or carry on with a folding oversized flip phone from the 90s. When I spoke with customer care recently she continued to repeat that they would not fix my computer or even look at it, for free. We had not at either of those points discussed anything about payment. I had not even finished sharing the issue."
"I have a Lenovo ThinkBook 14s. I have had it for about 4 months. Generally it has been a great laptop. However, I have recently developed an issue with my webcam. Being as we are in the middle of social distancing it's how I stay in touch with many people. I did the typical, googling, restarting, resetting, etc., nothing was working. I called tech support and the person on the other end was mumbling and impossible to understand. Sounded like I just woke her up from a nap. She literally made zero effort to try and remotely diagnose any issue. She immediatly tried to have my laptop sent to them. They didn't offer any alternatives."
"I have never received such a constant and consistent poor customer service. No customer service should leave you more angry and frustrated after speaking with them. I have had an issue with the webcam of an Ideapad for 4 months now. Every email has failed (do not use their online form!). 50% of live chats result in no agent available after 30min-1hr of waiting even during open hours. Every scheduled call through their website has never come through. At one point, I got someone on the phone and was told I would be called the following day. Guess what...it never happened."
I will try to make this as brief as possible by using bullet points.
"Researched this for months before purchase. Needed a powerful, lightweight, strong, good looking machine, and in fact I got all that BUT the outdated intel GPU drivers which Lenovo software says are up to date causes this machine to continually lag and freeze using Autocad and Rhino! Be warned... Lenovo support doesn't exist... this is my last Lenovo ever!"
"Working with Lenovo's help department has been a total and complete nightmare. I ordered a new Laptop and the ""suggested"" docking station. The docking station doesn't work with the laptop they suggested, so they sent me a new one. It also doesn't work. After >10 hours of phone calls and requests, I just want it to be over with and get a refund. I paid extra money for the 1 year onsite upgrade. They are making it challenging/impossible. If 0 stars were an option, I would do 0 stars."
"I am a HS math teacher in CA who has been ordered to shelter in place for 2 weeks already and 3.5 more in the future. 7 months ago I bought a IdeaPad L340 for just basic work. Well now I am an online teacher and need to use my camera - which after two sessions with remote tech support we now all realize doesn't work. I was offered the opportunity to give up my laptop so that it could be repaired under warranty. After explaining that I have no other means of working and no school computers available - we loaned them to all our students, Customer Service Rep Lisa from NC just kept repeating the same offer. This isn't customer service - not under the circumstances."
"I got my computer for one year and the screen left side blackout. I called several time as student, for manufucturer warranty no one can help me even to replace my computer. I got from Lenovo.com my second Lenovo. Jani I was in communication with end up wrote, he or she does not have to waste the time communicate with me. Bad customer service."
My Laptop Levono’s charger broke and I am in the middle of having to submit homework and I need a new charger! I spent 100 dollars for a universal and of course none of them fit! I called Levono cause I needed the model number for the charger company and it’s not on the laptop and I already threw out the box! But Levono won’t help me cause there is no serial number on it! They were very disrespectful and ignorant! I spent a lot of money for a good laptop and now I’m out the laptop and charger cause they won’t even help me to find the number!
"I bought my Thinkpad T490 from Lenovo official website and after a couple of weeks I realized that its touchpad doesn't work properly, I contacted Lenovo and tech support gave me a few pointers and it worked for a few days but the problem returned, so I called back and they said I have the option to replace it or return it for full refund. Since I needed a computer I said alright send me a replacement, however please make sure to send it to my new address as my address has changed. Lenovo customer service assured me that they will take care of it. After a few days that I didn't hear from them, I contacted them myself and I was told that my replacement laptop went to the old address and UPS will not change the address."
I bought a Lenovo laptop computer that I thought it was a bargain but to my knowledge that it's is the worst functioning computer ever. The battery alone is the worst. It takes forever to charge up and less then a hour to go dead. The loading on start up takes forever to get ready to use and always updating! Just to say I stay away from anything with or attached to lenovo with a 10 foot pole!
"2 Lenovo laptops in two years both failed in their own ways. Tried warranty service on second one without a receipt. Good service. They said sure. Off of the serial # they would honor warranty for in-op. keyboard. Mailed in, they sent me an email that the serial # was incorrect and would not honor warranty. Went back and forth with them and they said they would repair it but sent it back unrepaired. Done with them. Only HP and Dell laptops from here on out."
"Based on many years of using the great Lenovo computers, I bought a Lenovo IdeaPad S940 for $1773. It has something called BitLocker, which prevented me from using it unless I provided a Bitlocker recovery key, which I do not have. Microsoft, which developed Bitlocker, is supposed to have the key, but claimed that I should get it from Lenovo. Lenovo said it was Microsoft problem, and I should call them. After several rounds, I gave up and tried to return the machine, only to discover that I cannot do it-- Lenovo customer service keeps you on hold for 45 minutes and then hangs up. If you leave a number for them to call back, they do not call. So, sadly, that is the last Lenovo product I shall ever buy."
"I ordered a new laptop, a significant investment, which arrived 4 days later with serious malfunctions, to the point that it was barely usable as it was. I was disappointed, though not upset. Then I called customer service. I was redirected 3 times, was made to speak with 3 different people, was disconnected twice and after an hour of calling, waiting and being redirected had received no actual support. I did reach out to them four times and made a good faith effort to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, it was not resolved in any way, certainly not a courteous one."
"I purchased a laptop on Cyber Monday. I received a delivery date and my credit card said pending with the amount. It's a hold and changes to a charge when shipped. Wednesday I checked on it as we had not received it - my order was cancelled!! I was not notified of this! Today is Friday, there is still a pending amount on my credit card (I have called my credit card company). I have called Lenovo multiple time with extended waits - left a message per their request with my phone number... They called me back 6+ hours later, my phone rang, no one was there. I called it back - it was Lenovo! I have now placed an order with Dell - everything there ran very smooth with great customer service! GO DELL!"
"Ordered a laptop on Cyber Monday and purchased additional software. Then I received an invoice via email for the software, which I had already paid for. Called the number on the invoice and the representative had no record of the invoice. Told me to call the customer service department and when I did, received an automated message that the department was closed ""due to circumstances beyond their control"". Called the next day and waited on hold for 30+ minutes. Called back later and due to estimated wait times, I left a message for them to call me. No return call for a day so called again and left another message. Repeated this once more and still have not received a return call. Have decided to cancel my order."
I ordered a pc during their cyber week promotion. Everything about the process was terrible. They confirmed the order and stated it would be shipped in three days and delivered Friday of the same week. There was no contact from Lenovo and no updates other than confirmation of the order. Their call in center is a joke. I tried calling in and the automated system says the wait time will be over 45 minutes. It offered a call back service which I tried three times. ZERO call backs. Then the next day the entire call in system was down. Really? Talk about bush league.
"I purchased Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 2 on Nov 4th. To be specific part#20QV0007US. This unit was advertised as comes with IR webcam. During initial setup I noticed camera wasn't IR so I contacted customer support. Rep admit it should came with IR webcam so I made arrangement to ship unit to repair center. My unit arrived at repair center on 11/15/2019, since then they are keep saying nothing wrong with my laptop, it can not be repaired. While my unit is sitting at support center, lenovo updated product description just before Black Friday. Now service department don't even listen my story since they updated detail to match my unit with in non-IR webcam. Very bad business practice. I am fighting with them as I wrote this. I used laptop for 3 days and it sitting at repair center for 3 weeks now."
This is my first and last purchase from Lenovo. The ordering and delivery was late and after 2 days the system would not power off. The 3 hour support resulted in Lenovo replacing the systemboard. They then agreed to replace the system whick took over 3 weeks. Now they are delaying my credit. The orginal and replacement systems have been returned to Lenovo - I want my money back. Buy Acer - they are easier to deal with.
"I only write reviews when something is really bad or really good. This is the worst customer service ever. I purchased several tablets from the Lenovo website but for some reason it was undeliverable and ended up going back to Lenovo. The tracking was clear stating that it was returned to sender. Instead of automatically refunding me for the purchase, I had to call. Here is the beginning of the nightmare. The first call I made stated that wait times were long but I decided to wait nonetheless. After about 10 minutes I was told I could get a call back in approximately 30 minutes so I left a callback number and waited. After an hour and a half still no call back so I gave up. A few days later I decided to try again. This time I saw an option for live chat so I decided to try my luck with this. As soon as I got on, I was told that I was about 120 on the waiting list so I waited."
I ordered a computer and everything was fine. I decided to check the status of my order. Lenovo couldn’t find it. I showed them proof of my order. That didn’t matter. They offered no solution. I still need the laptop.
"I placed an order this morning (cyber Monday) for a laptop I needed for school. I specifically saved extra and worked my part time job over time to have enough money to buy the laptop specifically on this day because it was on sale. To make a long story short Lenovo cancelled my online order for no apparent reason and sent me a customer service number (855-253-6686) to call, I've been trying to speak to a service rep at Lenovo since 10am this morning. It is now 5:30 pm and still no luck. Cyber Monday is basically over. Lenovo took my money out the account, cancelled my order & I'm still stuck without a laptop."
"I purchased a $2,300 X1 Extreme Gen 2 about 3 months ago and it is already broke. Applications were crashing left and right, and I’m talking simple applications like Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and Excel. That should not be happening on this laptop. Thankfully I had purchased the premier warranty, which is essentially no warranty at all. They try to turn you into a computer technician yourself. I’ve completely erased everything off of my computer and did a USB recovery of Windows 10 pro just as the Lenovo tech advised. Now here I am without a working computer at all. It is a frozen black screen stuck at the personal settings portion of Windows 10. I’ve been on hold for over 40 minutes now and they are telling me to call back Monday because they are too busy. I’m hoping Lenovo makes this right, but so far I’m not feeling too optimistic."
"Bait and switch warranty. Sells you extended onsite warranty then tells you that’s only for ""the next transaction"". Made me mail in laptop immediately after purchasing onsite warranty. ** YOU LENOVO. Never buy again."
"Lenovo laptop charger failed after 5 months and contacted their chat support. To get in to the support had to to name, email and contact no. After 10 minutes wait one chat agent appeared and ask for details again. I just mentioned that the details are already given and it's in-efficient asking the same details. Chat agent abruptly discontinued the chat. Chat agent name is Marquetta."
I received this PC at annual Christmas company event and as an added precaution I registered the base warranty online at Lenovo site. As soon as I began using PC there were issues and they were reported. But due to their warranty policy my boss and I were scammed. After following All Lenovo base warranty policies and procedures I have been left without a PC for a year. But Lenovo has offered an extended 6 month warranty instead of 90 days. Lenovo customer service and warranty is nothing more than a scam to keep customer in a continuous repair until warranty expires not having to replace or refund consumer/buyer but to protect themselves.
"I am supremely disappointed with the customer support from Lenovo. I recently bought a laptop that I need for school. It's important for my studies that I am able to use 3 displays, I had to purchase an external dongle (adapter) to make this happen. Unfortunately the 3 displays only come up intermittently but I need it to work every time. I spoke to two separate support agents about my issue and neither put any effort whatsoever into seeking out the issue simply because I used an external display dock. No seeking information about updated drivers, not even ""have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in again"" literally 0 effort, 0 information seeking, 0 troubleshooting. All they gave me was a brief ""oh that's not our product, that must be the issue"". Even if it is an issue with the dongle I purchased, they gave absolutely no effort to look into the issue on the LENOVO laptop side. Trash customer support. Trash."
"I ordered a wireless mouse for $10 and received an AC adapter instead. Not a big deal, right? Lenovo policies could not make it more difficult to fix the company mistakes. They told me they would need to first ship me a label to return the product and once they receive the returned item, they would then send out the correct shipment. Ok no big deal except that I can go to the store and buy a wireless mouse much faster."
"Dear all, Do not buy and waste your money on Lenovo product, they never update any Android security updates. Whatever system you got on factory setting, will last forever on your lifetime, do not expect any latest Android Pie updates on your mobile. Nothing like all other brands."
"New $9000 laptop with premium warranty, P72 with all the bells and whistles, a 6 core Intel Xeon cpu, best video card P5200 Nvidia (NOT) ECC Ram etc etc. Had many Thinkpads in the past going back over 12-15 years. Still have many of them today running rock solid, the kids use them. But this new Laptop model P72 is total piece of garbage of the highest order. Failed Nvidia P5200 GPU and when it did operate the video quality was god awful. My Thinkpad W510 works better and it's about 10 years old. Also the Premium support is like the watching the 3 stooges, comical to put it mildly."
"Bought the IdeaPad for more than $500 and it worked for 3-days before the motherboard went out. Sent it back to Lenovo and now the motherboard is on back order and they have no ETA for the repair and will not replaced the laptop. Basically they are holding my laptop and they have my money. I am without a computer and no work now. Since the laptop was for a job my livelihood is in jeopardy and Lenovo can care less. They are crooks and scammers. Stay away from their products and services. I am going to have to hire an attorney to sue them for the equipment, lost revenue, and tarnishing my reputation as a producer."
"I've been a Lenovo user for years, I have owned at least 10 Lenovos for work, my daughter has owned two. Her Lenovo Yoga L380 recently overheated while in sleep mode. It was super hot to the touch. She unplugged it, to no avail. She took it to her college's tech support and they got the battery disconnected - and it finally cooled down. However - it won't boot up anymore. We tried everything Lenovo's tech support suggested, to no avail. I've never had problems with Lenovos so I did not get an extended warranty (3 years warranty would have been 50% of the purchase price!). We've only had the machine for 13 months, and Lenovo is not helping us. An overheating battery is indicative of a defective machine. We will NEVER buy another Lenovo product again. My company replaces our laptops every 3-4 years, and we have a choice of Lenovo vs MacBook. Guess what I will be getting in our next upgrade."
"I needed to buy a laptop and ship it to my colleague in the US, sounds pretty simple, right? Well, I wasted 3 days, talked to around 10 different customer service agents, tried to place an order around 10 times with different credit cards and had to call and ask my bank for special clearance. Every time I would try to place an order, the system would say that there is an authorization error and I have to contact my bank. Then I would call my bank and they would say that the payment went through without any problems (I also could see that as the charges were recorded under the Pending list on my online banking account). Then I would call Lenovo to see what's the issue and they would say that it's the bank."
"I bought this brand new a few years ago thinking it was a high quality laptop at Best Buy. I regret it so much. Every time windows updates, I lose drivers and my features on the computer disappear. For example, I bought this because it has a touchscreen. Every time windows updates (which you are forced to do automatically with these), I lose the touchscreen. I've spent the last 8 years trying to fix the touch screen on my computer. NEVER AGAIN will I use this company or brand. Buyer beware, and avoid the mistake I did."
"I have always believed that Lenovo products were high quality and expected the same from how they support their product. I gave each of my three daughters a Lenovo Yoga laptop. I paid more to buy them a quality, product that would enhance their learning. The customer service experience was a run around and nightmare. Shame on me for believing in a company that would stand behind their product rather than claiming we are out of warranty. The concern was addressed when the warranty was in place. We have documented history of the issue. I took the concern to an escalation team who NEVER CALLED ME BACK (I was told three days but waited two weeks). If you buy their product do not expect ANY SUPPORT, you're on your own. Shocked and very disappointed in their follow through. Lesson learned."
Lenovo has terrible service. Once you purchase you can't reach a real person. I ordered a Lenovo laptop from their Lenovo Pro site. It was in-stock and a pre=configured laptop (not custom configured in any way). Their site said it was in-stock and would ship in 1-3 business days. That is the reason I ordered the specific model that I ordered. My Microsoft Surface Book 2 is failing - the battery has swelled and is pushing the back out and the keyboard up so it won't shut or sit flat on desk anymore. Microsoft is going to repair the unit even though it is out-of-warranty. But I have to send the laptop to Microsoft and wait for it to be returned.
I bought an X1 Yoga with a high spec because it would ship in 1-3 days. 9 days later I’m still waiting and each time I call I get told it will be the next days. Completely misleading customer service and terrible experience. I will never buy again - and this was my fourth (and the machine we were using to assess a corporate purchase).
This is truly an awful company. I bought a Lenovo Yoga 730 15 inch on August 29th 2019. The product came defected and so they will ship me a new one. I kept the old one until the new one came and yet again that new product was defected as well. I return both laptops and the pen. I received two emails stating that both products were received on September 25th. The email stated it would take 10 business days for them to return my refund. It took them over 14 days.
"You are better off purchasing a Mac or Dell for more to get better customer service unless you want to be calling 3-4 to follow up on a simple issue and being put on hold forever. Also, the internet keeps dropping on my laptop, and it isn't a router or modem issue because it was perfectly fine with my previous Mac laptop. I completely regret the purchase."
"Nearly two months ago, I purchased a Lenovo IdeaPad 330S 15.6” Laptop (Intel Core i7-8550U/256GB SSD/8GB RAM). I am currently a student finishing a research-based MSc, and I rely heavily on a laptop to complete my work - thus, despite my small income, the quality of the product I was getting was extremely important to me, so I forked over just over $1 000 for what I thought would be a good machine to use to finish up my data analysis/thesis for this degree."
"I ordered a laptop dock from Lenovo's website, and they told me it shipped. UPS tracking says that the order never shipped. I have contacted them three times over the last week and received promises that they will check and get back to me, but they never respond. They tell me that they have to ""check with logistics"", but they won't let me talk to ""logistics"". Almost two weeks after its supposed delivery date, it's still not here. I will not be doing any further business with Lenovo."
I warn anyone who is thinking of buying this computer... DO NOT!! It has had issues from the very beginning and when you call tech support they will not help you without paying. I paid a lot of many for it and certainly would think they could help fix any issues. I wish I had never made the purchase. I have had lots of laptops over the years and have never been asked to pay more to get help.
"I tried to purchase a C530 model and immediately after entering my payment information, they kicked me out of checkout. The price was then increased by $100 and the coupon code I had used was no longer valid. Very shady to advertise a low price with available coupons, and then increase the price right as someone is trying to actually buy from you."
I bought ThinkPad tablet x1 Gen 3. It cost me around £2000 with top spec. Quality is questionable. My tablet stopped working after 23 days of receiving it. Shocking knowing that it passed some military test. Lenovo with partner River Ireland has extremely bad customer service. It looks like they are amateurs trying to get piece of the market by not looking at their customers. Just selling goods and services and ignoring us. Like dishonest people do.
"For a minute there after Lenovo acquired ThinkPad brand from IBM you thought there was some real progress in the brand with the ThinkPad X1 Tablet first and second generations. But taking away hardware via the front facing camera flash, adding fan cooling and a couple of dozen grams, just for a slightly faster i7 processor, and now the silver ThinkPads with this new line of trackball-less ThinkPad keyboard next generations, and you begin to hear the sound starting of a loud proverbial flush of the ThinkPad brand down the toilet. Calling IBM from the bullpen..."
"I had a very bad experienced about Lenovo Yoga laptop, very bad product, I had bought 2 month back. From one day laptop is regularly going to service centre, very bad experienced of service centre. I request to all consumer please don't buy Lenovo laptops. I made going to consumer court for this if anyone wants to come contact me. **. Lenovo is very worst. Don't don't don't buy Lenovo."
"Basically, their onsite warranty is non existent. Don't spend the extra money, and stick with Depot, as this is all you get anyways. Reading their terms and conditions (after buying and needing to use), after 2 months of operation, the SSD failed. Their solution: mail me a replacement hard drive that will take 4 days to get here. Then I have to install it myself, and set up the entire laptop from scratch."
"This is the worst company I have ever ordered a laptop from.... period. I ordered a laptop in March of 2019. Without notice, they pushed the ship date about 4-5 weeks. I called and they blamed it on a custom order (I changed the size of the hard drive). They offered me $100 off and said they would contact the warehouse team to get a status. Neither of these things were ever done. Late in April they updated the shipping date to a few days earlier. Great! But I noticed it said that it would be shipped and received on the same day. Then the next day they updated the shipping a day later... and the next day a day later. Obviously, it wasn't going to be received the same day it was set to ship."
"I paid $1300 for what I assumed would be a good laptop. I could not have been more wrong! I've barely used it, I write papers on it and do basic internet searches. Just 3 years after purchase, it has had a total hard drive failure. Best Buy told me this is a known hard drive issue for this laptop, and therefore these hard drives aren't even used anymore. I contacted Lenovo and they couldn't care less! Save your money, take my advice, and don't buy a Lenovo!"
"I wouldn't know anything about their products because it was impossible to order from Lenovo. Short story is Lenovo's customer service won't do anything to help you. Long story, I tried to purchase a laptop, and they cancelled the order because my shipping address was different from my billing address. It was especially difficult because I was moving and on a time limit. They did not refund me for the cancelled order until 4 days later, despite their customer service telling me to give the refund 24 hours every day I reached out to them. This order was scheduled to be delivered in one week."
To start I love Lenovo products... key word products. They have got to have the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have been trying to get a refund for a faulty laptop. I started the looonng process of talking to customer service and opening a case on Monday. I was told that a manager would have to approve the refund and would contact me within 48 business hours. Needless to say no contact was made.
"It was godawful from start to finish. Monitor stopped working within 3 weeks (!) of purchase and when I contacted Best Buy for warranty agreement they have advertised they told me they don't support it because Lenovo reneged on it and that I should contact them directly. I did and they said I'd have to send it out in a mail and wait for weeks. Thanks - I actually work on my computer, that's why I bought it."
"Doesn't this sound like a best trade deal? :) I really wanted to just share my experience with this brand. I own Lenovo Yoga 910 (bought in 2017 in Best Buy). When 1 year guarantee period passed, my touchscreen and USB A port stopped working! Then, after several months it just died.** During that ""several months"" period of time I went through unimaginable amount of driver installations, forum searches and Lenovo forum cursing. :D (Did you try turning it off and on?)"
"From the purchase of goods in 2-3 months, it began to work poorly and break from the strong heating. The connecting parts began to melt. I sent it to the service of goods. It stayed there for over a month. When they sent it back, they said that they formatted it. What is the connection? Problems also continued from heating. Stopped connecting internet and from strong heating, the computer just turned off. 2 more times it was taken to the service. And there it was longer than the first time. For the third time it stayed there for 4 months and at the same time the warranty period ended and they returned it to me with the words that, ""You will pay for the next time since the guarantee has expired."" I did not use it for long. Then the screen fell completely out of heat and the motherboard burned down. I wrote to Hong Kong. But no answer. A waste of money, time and nerves."
"I purchased my Lenovo Yoga 2 11"" laptop in September of 2016, so it is now 2-1/2 years old. After 2 MONTHS, it wouldn't turn on so I spent a couple hours with their technical support before they said I needed to send it back to them for repair. A couple of days to get the shipping box, they kept it for a couple weeks to replace the hard drive and it has been a slow, clunky computer ever since. I have taken it back to factory refresh 3 times, continually clean the cache on the hard drive, defragment the drive a couple times a year and have even bought software to ""tune up"" the crappy PC. Still, when I turn it on, even when it is only in Sleep mode, I have to wait over 5 minutes before it ""warms up"" and even then, it takes 60 seconds before an app or program opens when I click on it. I'm done with this junk and I won't even try to sell it because I would feel bad sticking anybody else with this. HP, Dell, Toshiba...but no more Lenovo."
eCoupon code didn't work. Tried to purchase a Yoga 730 (15”) Laptop (81CU000TUS) through the Lenovo (Canada) Website. The web price was $1699.99 CAD with an eCoupon savings of $455 CAD so a final price of $1214.99 CAD before taxes. eCoupon code did not work during checkout so I chatted with a customer service agent and they told me that the best they could do was was offer me a price (in USD) that was equivalent to about $1620 Canadian dollars so a $455 discount became an $80 discount - really disappointing and a big waste of my time.
"I'm deeply disappointed by my experience with my Lenovo Thinkpad. This product broke twice in 2.5 years, both times for the same reason (battery issues). When I recently tried to get it repaired, the company said they won't honor the warranty and they won't fix the product (even if I pay). I was disgusted that this company won't provide service on an expensive product they sold me only 2.5 years ago. Apple or Dell would never do this to their customers. This is my last Lenovo."
"The touch screen failed before it was a year old, still under warranty. Lenovo made me send it off and kept it for several weeks in order to fix it. A few weeks after getting it back (during which time my one year warranty expired) the screen started showing a diagonal black line near the top of the screen that shouldn't be there and never goes away."
"I purchased a Lenovo Yoga 530 (i5) from Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. I moved to Melbourne, Australia immediately after. And the Laptop's WiFi adapter started malfunctioning, amongst other things. The fingerprint scanner is crap too and the battery back-up has already fallen by half. I requested Lenovo Australia to help me. They picked it up for repairs under warranty. But refused to give me a spare one to use in the meantime. If this harassment wasn't enough, when they did pick it up, they made me pay for the secure packaging of it. Then their pick-up partner, DHL, refused to give me a time for the pick-up and wasted an entire day of mine where I just sat at home waiting for them."
"On Feb 19, 2019 I ordered a 730 yoga laptop for my daughter for her birthday which was on March 21st. I considered opening the box to inspect it, but decided I wanted to give her the experience of opening it and setting up everything herself. When we opened the laptop on her birthday, the screen had horizontal lines intermittently showing on the screen. When I contacted Lenovo, they said it was out of the 30 Days from purchase, and they would not replace it even though I paid for the extra 1 yr. warranty. After MANY calls and conversations explaining my situation, my case got escalated where they were still ONLY willing to offer repair. I pd. $1200 - from Lenovo.com and now I basically have a refurbished laptop. 15 yr. Lenovo customer, and that's how I get treated? Thanks for nothing..."
"Laptop never worked properly. Customer service does everything in their power to get rid of you. You need to send multiple emails in which you need to convince them to receive warranty service. Even after sending back my laptop 2 times, it’s still not working. I regret buying this laptop and should have read all the reviews. Turns out they were true. I experience the exact same problems. I strongly advise anyone to consider buying any other brand. I can’t imagine it could be worse than Lenovo."
"Purchased a Lenovo A340 All In One desktop. Comes with 4 GB in memory, upgradable to 8 GB. Got the extra RAM. The instructions tell you to pop the bottom of the cover and pry the back off. The problem is ... prying the back off cracks the screen (and the computer doesn't boot anymore). All I did was follow their instructions. Support said ... too bad. Avoid this company. Terrible design if you need to get into the system."
"Just bought my first Lenovo, an Ideapad 530S with Core i7 with the top configuration. This was to replace my Dell Inspiron, which served me very well for 10 years with zero problem. This Lenovo is frustrating with issues on the screen flickering, and now the wifi (by the way I've got the top configuration for wifi, the 2x2 abgn or something like this) it just keep disconnecting every 5 or 10 minutes and sometimes takes several seconds to even find my wifi signal again. The support is attentive and seems to be solved the screen flickering, but the wifi just keep wasting my time and annoying."
"My mother in law bought a Lenovo smart display from Walmart for my wife, worked for about 3 months then the display screen stopped working. I called 1-877-453-6686 to talk to the technical/warranty service. I was informed the product was covered under warranty after submitting my serial number. Then I was informed I have to ship my Lenovo back to them via a courier service or FedEx whichever, and I HAVE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING! That's great customer service Lenovo (SARCASTIC). Jen (From India) estimated shipping at probably $20.00. Not buying again from Lenovo. We're probably going to sell it and buy from another vendor that SUPPORTS their products fully."
"I recommend that prospective computer buyers ""Don't ever buy a Lenovo product!!!! Ever since I have owned this computer it has been slower than the 10 year old Toshiba laptop that I owned. Everything I that I have done to keep it tuned up and make it faster has been to no avail. It takes 3.5 to 5 minutes to boot-up and so slow that I can watch the icons load up one at a time? The Lenovo help desk all but told me ""It is what it is"". They are as bad as the computer is slow and locking up on boot ups."
"I purchased the new edition Lenovo Yoga 730 13 in from Best Buy October 12th, 2018, which came highly recommended by the good folks at Best Buy. This is the most expensive laptop I have ever purchased, along with the useless warranty, I am out of about $1,500. I have had this laptop less than 4 months when it stop working. I bought this high dollar purchase for my home business. Long story short, the software and driver does not talk to each other. I was told at Geek Squad that of course this would not be covered under the manufacture warranty."
"I bought two Thinkpads, one did not work. The touchpad did not function properly, and the computer would hang up. I was told to send the computer back, and received an RA. After ten days, I called to see where my computer was. I was told that the ""six working days"" return was not real... that there was a part on order, but they could not tell me when the part would be obtained. I asked where the part was coming from... The rep said from the same building, but that they had no idea when. When I asked who could give me an idea when the computer would be fixed, I was told that they could not do that. This is absolutely ridiculous for an international company with the name on the wall!!!"
"The service is truly appalling and I am in disbelief a company in today's world can operate in this way, I have spent the the last 13 days on the phone to every department to find out why my laptop was not delivered. Today I have finally been offered a refund but the hours and hours of phone calls have exhausted me. All I wanted was the computer I ordered, even when they admitted that I had not received it you'd think they might have offered to maybe send out the same model again but maybe expedite it quicker because I have been so patient. I was told it would take 10-14 days plus the delivery of 7 days. I even requested that they could ship it direct to me but just to request this can take 3 days and the reply is not certain???"
I bought an IdeaPad in February 2018. In January of 2019 it stopped charging the battery. I sent it to be repaired under the warranty. They sent it back saying it was fixed but it then wouldn't show a battery at all. They have now had it almost a month but still no updates. I am a college student and ended up having to buy a hp laptop to use for school. Lenovo is just to slow doing the repair. I would not recommend.
"I sent in a Lenovo Yoga laptop in for repair. 25 days after Lenovo received it, the website states that they were waiting for a part. I called in to inquire about this, and was told that there was no way to know when it was coming in. Frustrated, I asked multiple times whether there was any way to find out how long it would take. The rep kept insisting that he could accurately tell me when, but then let stating that it has to go through multiple places to find parts and that it might take 2-3 days or it could take much longer. The rep was outright rude and cut me off. When I cut him off after rambling about the same things over and over, he gave me a “warning”. Good riddance to someone who cannot even provide me with any answers and who has no more knowledge than the website itself provides. I will take my business elsewhere on my next laptop purchase."
"Ordered a Logitech wireless keyboard on 12/3 as a Christmas present. Contacted me on 12/12 saying it's back ordered and will notify when it ships. Received email 1/4 asking how I like my product. Hmmm never received anything. Contact customer support and they say, ""Sorry. It's still back ordered but we will push through and ask sales to expedite."" So how do they respond? Email 1/7, ""Your order is cancelled."" They hold for over 30 days and try to submit payment and beyond the time limit so it won't go through and naturally they don't have the item any longer so you can't reorder. False advertisement. Bad business ethics. Poor customer service. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM."
"I bought a Lenovo IdeaPad 330 from WalMart a few months ago. The screen suddenly went blank. When I tried logging on to Lenovo's Warranty site, the Lenovo domain is listed for sale. When I called their customer service number they told me it would cost $199 to fix it! It’s still under warranty! I wish I had done more research and found this site before I purchase this junk from a scam company!"
"I purchased the Lenovo 330s in October 2018, and during a bios update in December 2018 the unit display went blank and to date, has not turned back on. I can hear the unit running, but I have no display. Lenovo's answer to this problem is to repair my unit. However, I believe the unit should be replaced entirely. At any event, I have no plans on purchasing another computer from Lenovo. I will say that I originally purchased this unit as a second laptop, as I use my Macbook Pro as my primary unit (Thank goodness). However, there are times when I prefer a Windows platform and simply needed an inexpensive laptop to write papers. This has been a disappointing experiencing and I have lost confidence in Lenovo as an organization."
"My computer won’t be a year old until January 18th and it stopped charging about 4 mo the ago. Had someone look at the charger and tested and it is fine was told that it is probably the charging port on the computer. Got a hold of Lenovo and they say that they can’t fix until I send a copy of the receipt through email, have tried that several different times and their server won’t accept the email. How can you email something to them if the server won’t accept it. I am very dissatisfied with them, I would not recommend a Lenovo product to anyone, all they do is rip people off. I really don’t even give them a 1 star rating but you have to rate something on them I really think they should be rated at a zero star rating."
Lenovo laptops are so bad. I have TP E580. Worst laptop ever. Terrible cooling. Never buy laptops from this company. Every BIOS update has made it worst. Fan noise is horrible. Fan run even on light browsing.
"Just received an X1 Lenovo Thinkpad, which cost over $1,600. It arrived with a major scratch on the screen. It is perplexing that any basic quality control would not see have caught this problem. Now I need to go through the whole process of getting it fixed."
"Let me begin by saying I will never buy anything from Lenovo ever again. The only reason I bother to write this review is so that Lenovo can hopefully address some of the many problems within the company, which might help other customers avoid the same ordeal that I have experienced. I originally placed the order (**) on Black Friday, and despite being reassured by the sales representative that it was processed successfully, I found out that the order was later cancelled by Lenovo (!?!?!). I then placed a new order (**) for the same products on December 7th. Due to the problems I had faced with my previous order as well as the fact that the order contained Christmas gifts, I specifically selected expedited delivery and the sales representative guaranteed that my order would be shipped the same day."
Their service department is absolutely pathetic. Spoke with an agent initially and gave them a complete description of my problem. She ordered a box for me in which I can ship my laptop. I got an email saying that servicing usually takes 6 working days. This is my 10th day and still nothing. Their website just says that my repairs are blocked on unavailability of a part. But it has been 8 days and there is no status change. When I called them their IVR goes into an endless loop and in the end they say there are no available agents which is pathetic. After waiting for like 30 mins on the call you get just disconnected without a clue and their website is not useful as well. They do not understand the value of a customer. My work is pending without my laptop and there is no communication from their side. Seems like they took my laptop and kept it for themselves.
"I ordered a laptop from Lenovo last Friday. I received an email a few hours later that the order was canceled. Their sales department is closed on weekends, so it had to wait until next week. I called them today on Wednesday to get it resolved. They verified everything, placed the order for me again, and then an hour or two later I received a call from some out of state phone number. I didn't answer because I was already on a phone call with someone else. A few minutes later I got an email that my order is on hold pending further review. The email had no contact info. I called their sales to get it resolved. They said it was some other department, but I can't call them directly. They will call me within 24 hours. --- ""Hey, don't call us, we will call you when we see fit."" ---"
"I ordered two Lenovo Tablets on the 13th of December. At that time I was assured that they would ship in two to three days and arrive before Christmas. They were birthday presents for my sons. Lo and behold now they haven't even shipped yet as of today's date. They claim they're not going to ship until the 20th and I will not receive them until January 2nd, they completely misled and misrepresented themselves. I never would have ordered them if they had told me that this was going to happen or was even a possibility. Customer service completely unhelpful. They said it was an estimate and I said, “Nowhere on your page does it say estimate. Tell me where it says that."" and I was conveniently disconnected. Now I'm going to have very disappointed little boys for Christmas and I'm going to look very bad in front of them. I will never deal with Lenovo again. Very very disappointed in them."
"I just bought this computer less than 60 days ago. Turned it off and could not turn it back on again. Took it to Best Buy where I purchased it from and they told me my contract only covers hardware issues, not software. The Geek Squad told me that Lenovo is notorious for having those kinds of software issues. The only options they gave me was to spend hundreds of dollars more for fixing a problem not caused by me, or spend 25 -30 dollars more to get it sent back to Lenovo for shipping. Neither Lenovo or Best Buy has good policy returns. I will not buy another Lenovo and furthermore I will look for those products anywhere else but Best Buy. Neither Lenovo or Best Buy stand behind their products."
"Extremely bad customer service. No wonder why they blocked the review section on their website!!! Bought a laptop 7 months ago and it never worked properly. After 3 repairs, 11 weeks in repairs, more than 15 calls (long wait time), Lenovo does not want to replace it as per the law. I was finally transferred to the escalation service, it took 4 working days to get a callback. The case manager asked me to reply to an email he sent me with the detailed history. 5 days after, I called back agent and he said he never received both of my emails (initial email + a reminder after 3 days) and that he will investigate the email issue and call me back in 15 fifteen minutes. He never called back and don’t answer my phone calls, so I left a message. He never called me back. After 3 weeks in escalation, I sent a letter of formal notice to the head office and they refused it. It seems they piss off their customer so they will give up."
"I purchased a Lenovo T480s in June 2018. It had a very loud fan noise out of the box. I should have immediately sent it back but I had to leave for a 2 week trip in 3 days and could not get another computer in time. I called Lenovo and they told me that, even though I had not purchased on site service, they would have someone out the next day. I called back the next day and they said they were sorry but they would again have someone out the next day. The next day (day 3 since the arrival of the machine) I called again when they did not show and they told me I would have to send it in for repairs which would take 7 days. They told me no one ever should have told me on site service was available."
"I purchased a Lenovo computer and Adobe Creative Cloud, total amount was $909.90. On my account the first pending charge is for $909.90. There's now a second pending charge for $789.95, which they say is because the Adobe Creative Cloud shipped, so they have to reauthorize for the remaining amount. This has put my balance in the negative. They cannot reverse either of the charges until the computer ships, and cannot tell me when that will be. This is unacceptable. The $909.90 pending charge should have been reversed prior to the second pending charge. I've been trying to resolve this for over an hour now and still don't have a resolution."
"I tried purchasing an item on their website. The discount looked pretty good. The price went down to 67.99$ from 222$. A 77% discount. When I added it to my cart it went down to 55$. I thought, ""Amazing!"" I go to checkout, all of a sudden there is an error. I contact customer service and refresh my page then price goes to 139$. Customer service said they would be happy to honor the 67 but I need to prove it. Otherwise it's 139$. I didn't have proof of when it was 55$ so they wouldn't honor that. It seemed like they edited my shopping cart to increase the price. I was not happy at all."
"From day 1 this is the slowest computer I've ever owned. I replaced a 12 year old Lenovo with i3 processor with this ThinkPad 470 with i5 processor and the old one still boots up faster and pulls up any application faster. I get a new laptop for work every 2 years so I've gone through a lot over the last 14 years, and this is by far the worst performing I've ever owned. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
"Really enjoyed the product until 2 months in just stopped working. Had it registered for Warranty after purchase with Lenovo. Sent to Lenovo Repair Center in Memphis TN for warranty repairs. They done absolutely no online updates the 1st month had to call continually to get updates this started Nov 1st 2018 was told halo pad was bad and motherboard, basically everything but the touchscreen. This was 1st week they were waiting on parts. I did get short with them then said, ""You should just send a replacement because you will have it for a month so that would be 1/3 of the time I owned it."" Got a smart remark back from service on that one."
"Purchased ThinkPad online. At checkout was told item would ship within 48 hours. I got no shipping confirmation email after 48 hours so I checked order status online. Was now due to ship in 4 more days (4 day delay). Then after another 24 hours got another email stating it ""might"" ship in the next 30 days. I called customer service, got a Filipino call tree and was told they couldn't verify when it would ship but they would get with the ""fulfillment team"" and email me within 24 hours to verify shipping. Waited 48 hours. Heard nothing."
"I've only bought 1 Lenovo item from Lenovo directly (computers as well from other resellers). It is a Smart Display (like Google's Hub). I will never buy a Lenovo product unless the likes of Amazon buys the company. The smart display arrived defective (screen did not power on) and I spent over an hour the phone with over 5 individuals who did not understand English, was disconnected twice, and referred to 4 different phone numbers. I'm still not even sure if the warranty process I tried to initiate was successful. Horrendous experience top to bottom and I highly recommend avoiding this company. The products are usually pretty well made, but if something goes wrong, it's going to be a hassle to say the least if you want to get it fixed."
"I purchased a Lenovo Y540 for my son X-mas 2017. After 10 months the keyboard stopped working. I experienced several unsuccessful interactions with customer service before my case was escalated to a case manager who replaced the machine with a supposedly new Y740. However, this took several phone calls, long hold times, and several technicians who made useless recommendations over the course of 3 weeks. After two weeks, with the new Y730, the motherboard stopped working. I emailed my case manager. I phoned my case manager. Never with a response. Finally, after two months, I received my money back. What a horrendous experience. Do not buy these products. The entire experience was a nightmare."
"We tried to place our $2,000.00 order for a desktop tower, 3 monitors, and much more since 11/21/2018. We have now placed the order 3 times and they keep cancelling it for no reason after we submit payment. They have no idea what hand is feeding the other. Each and every department tells us to contact the other departments for help and place you in a big circle or nothing getting accomplished for hours out of your work day. I would recommend never buying from Lenovo unless you already have an established good relationship because they do not put the customers first."
"[ISSUES WITH THE LENOVO Y530] If you want to buy this laptop think twice because I have severe issues with it. I believe that no matter the price of the computer you buy, every laptop company should have a top-notch customer care. And it's in the way companies handle customer's issue that you recognize a good brand... So that's why I'm sharing my bad experience: I bought the Lenovo Legion Y530 on the 28th of October. 10 days later, he wasn't working anymore, had to go to a Lenovo shop. The same day, I had to go to another Service Center (in Kuala Lumpur) because my computer wasn't still working."
"I upgraded my Spectrum service in order increase bandwidth and speed. The 5g wifi would not populate on my available networks. It populates automatically on another laptop and my cellphones. After 2 calls and a long wait the rep stated they could help me for a ""nominal"" fee. I will never buy Lenovo again."
"I study Computer Science and I sent the laptop in for repairs having been told it would take three days. They sent it back a week later and the screen would not turn on. It eventually took 3 months to repair (they kept saying it will only be one more week the whole time), during which I was forced to use my computer from 2007 which could not run any of the programs I needed to do my final project. I asked if they could send a loaner computer to me during this period since I could not afford to buy one and not only did they refuse, they had no sympathy and offered no other solution."
"For reasons unknown, my P71 laptop went into airplane mode. And, what I didn't know and am disappointed with is that battery charging was therefore, disabled. All I noticed was that the battery was going dead; that it was not charging. I was in a foreign country and my AC adapter appeared to be defective. But, not so. Lenovo simply disabled charging without giving me any notification whatsoever. Not nice. So, I'm running around with my head cut off for hours trying to figure out if I can purchase a new AC adapter and pulling my hair out. Then I notice the airplane on the network icon and switch airplane mode off and voila, charging starts. How dumb. What a waste of my time."
"I was experiencing problems such as: 1) I couldn't type anything in the search box, 2) When I clicked on the window on the bottom left my programs wouldn't come up, 3) I was unable to brighten the screen on F11 & F12, 4) I couldn't change the volume (higher or lower) on the F2 and F3 key. Microphone on Cortana wouldn't respond. I clicked on Driver Finder, got that working, it took a while for it to work once I requested that it find drives. When it was completed my computer worked properly. I recommend this for most problems."
"I really do not care who reads this. I have had the absolute worst experience with this company that I am gonna send every product I have purchase this holiday back to them! I would rather not deal with them at all! How is it that I have something in my cart to purchase, press the PayPal option, log in, select account and it reverts me back to an empty cart. Not only did it take forever to get to the shopping cart but the apologizing that the system is overloaded is not a relevant excuse. You obviously did not prepare for the traffic you received. Which is not anyone's fault but yours as a company, as a director of sales, as a reputable business. There is zero reason if you had properly prepared for this to even happen. Period. I had even selected my payment option and at that instance my shopping cart should have been accounted for. No one should have had access to the item in my cart until I had failed to process a payment."
"I can't believe they are a large corporation that can have such an incredibly incompetent warranty department. On-site warranty where they don't show up to the appointment and don't call. TWICE! When you're able to get a hold of another rep, they disregard any errors. Been using Thinkpads since the IBM days for the last 17 years, but it ends now."
"If I could give less than one star I would. I purchased a Lenovo Idea Pad at the end of 2017. A few months later the screen started to flicker and shake. Upon calling customer service they referred me to some online solutions which worked temporarily, but the problem continued to happen again. I then was on the phone on more than one occasion for up to an hour or more running through new drivers, BIOS updates etc. 10 months and multiple phone calls later, they told me I could pay them $99 for a repair kit, or send my computer back for a repair which could take up to 15 days for a turn around. I use my computer every day for work and neither of these ""solutions"" are acceptable. So less than a year later, I'm now looking to purchase a new laptop. Although polite, the customer service reps offer NO acceptable solutions. Do NOT purchase a Lenovo product! Save your money and purchase from a more reputable company."
Worst investment ever. I wish I would have done more researched before buying a Lenovo Yoga laptop. I bought the laptop 7 months ago and have only been using it the last 2 months consistently. I go to open my laptop and see that there is a crack down the center of my laptop and other cracks forming. I keep my laptop in a laptop sleeve pouch and in a backpack at all times.
"I purchased a Lenovo T570 laptop on August 20, 2017 and received it in about 2 weeks. For the first few months I had no issues and enjoyed my new laptop. However, about 7 months in my laptop began going to the black Boot Menu screen when the computer came out of sleep mode. I didn't think much of it because it only happened once or twice. In mid-April 2018, the computer finally stopped booting to the Windows operating system all together. I tried calling customer service to see if someone could walk me through the Boot Menu. The first 3 reps simply told me to ship my laptop back to Lenovo and that I would have it back in about 1 month's time. As a graduate student that was not an option, so I was able to find a few online sources to try and diagnose the problem myself."
"Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. It was an ok machine for about 6 mos. It stopped charging then, some internal problem. I sent it into Lenovo repair. In the emails they say repairs generally take about 9 days. They have now had mine for almost 2 months, but worst of all they won't tell me anything. I have contacted several times for an update, and get nothing but excuses. ""I'm sorry the website is down."" ""I'm sorry we'll send the repair people and email."" ""I'm sorry we don't have the pieces, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."" Well I'm sorry I ever bought the machine, and I will never buy another Lenovo product ever. I will however try to make sure others don't get trapped as I have."
I just got a Lenovo Ideapad 330 and it won't see my HP printer on WiFi. I have tried everything I know with drivers etc with no success. I called Lenovo support and they told me they can't help since it is not their printer. They want me to go pay someone to get support. My warranty is good until Aug 2019 but I will be calling Best Buy to see what they say about this vendor and will never buy from Lenovo again.
"Charger is huge and heavy so falls out of wall socket and causes wielding inside the socket when half out, constant pushing back in breaks the weak prongs, had under a year on 3rd charger. Cost $59 a charger. Lenovo won’t replace but JB Hi-Fi has been giving them to me for free but has ran out. Two screws have fallen out the base and now the screen has snapped the weak plastic as it’s not supported by one of the screws that has fallen out. So now the screen is broken off from the base on one side."
My situation is the same as everyone else's. I bought a Yoga 920 used it 4 times at most and it broke down. I sent it to repair and have never heard again. If I don't call they don't communicate and when you do contact them they tell you the same thing over and over. They are working on it and they will contact you. My last communication to them was asking for my money back; at this point I feel I was robbed. I purchased something I don't have/cant' use.
"I could sit here and write about all the problems I have had with my 5 month old Lenovo Yoga 920 glass, and the Premium Service contract I purchased but I will spare you the stories about how my battery failed, my laptop got so hot you could smell it burning, the constant power drain that leaves a battery with maybe 3 hrs of life, the keyboard that sticks, the subpar wifi, the failure of the screen to rotate, or the screen suddenly flips and you can't flip it back, the weeks I went only being able to use the laptop if it was plugged in, or the loose and in need of repair connective ports (usb thunderbolt)."
My N23 computer wanted me to update Windows. I tried that and it told me I didn't have enough memory and to free up memory. It took me a long time to learn that there were hidden programs taking up all the memory and they could not be removed. Stuff like Microsoft movies. They sent me link from a British newspaper explaining how to buy extra memory. I was having none of that. I told Lenovo to take the computer back. They told me to get lost. I contacted the store where I bought it and they are giving me a refund. I am thinking of suing Lenovo but I need to come up with a cause of action. I am liking consumer fraud.
"I bought my Lenovo Flex pad and within a few the software crashed. I called Lenovo IT support. They troubleshooted the computer and told me my hardware was fine and directed me to software, where they immediately told me I had to pay to fix which I did in good faith. I was told I had 3 days after the issue was resolved to call back with any other software issues. They were not able to do a recovery, the only other option I had was manufacture reset which I agreed to. These tech did not know the product, I had to be telling them that my computer did not have disk drive, they did not know what software came on the device. They sent me the Windows 10 recovery disk, I had to wait for what was suppose to be the correct recovery disk to be sent to me, which was still not able to recovery system. So now we I back to square one and they are telling me that it is a hardware issue. Which they had initially said it was not"
"I bought a Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th Gen laptop and right out of the box it had at least 8 dead pixels on the screen. I sent it to the repair depot and it came back to me quickly, which I was happy about. However, upon turning on the computer, I immediately noticed that the screen was now off center--there was a black bar on the left side and across the bottom that was not present on the top or right. The screen was not like this when I first got the device, so clearly the technicians at the depot caused this issue when replacing the LCD."
"I bought a Lenovo Laptop Ideapad 320 November 20, 2017 with a 2 year replacement plan from North Augusta, SC. at Office Depot. Today I accidentally place a book on my across my keyboard and mouse area and it apparently damaged it. I went through Square Trade & they directed me to Lenovo who basically said my warranty expires in 6 days. HMMM. You do the math. Called on two separate occasions where I was to talk with a supervisor and hung on both times after 30 min. each of wait time. HMMM. Oh, by the way, when you call these guys you WILL BE SPEAKING WITH INDIA, not America. Good Luck! Right! I am absolutely livid about this."
I have just been told that my 5 year old laptop that works perfectly well is obsolete because they can't fix the cheap hinges they used to build it. I have seen that this is a common problem. A £900 laptop going in the bin as they built the laptop with an inferior casing. What a waste and another addition to the plastic mountain. I will never buy from that company again and I'd advise anyone looking for a laptop to look elsewhere.
"They sent me the wrong machine, accused me of switching it. Now almost 2 months later I'm fighting for my refund. What a joke this company is! If I could give a zero star review I would have. Not worthy of 1 star."
I purchased a 720S-13ARR directly from Lenovo. Build quality is good. I purchased this because I like the style (slim and light) and the price was very good compared to others I looked at. The laptop is reasonably fast and I had no problem connecting it with Bluetooth devices and a TV with a separately purchased USB-C to HDMI dongle. Battery seemed to last a decent amount of time and for the limited time I used it there were few issues. Except some major ones. There are video glitches that could not be overcome. There were bios and driver problems. Apparently the bios was not compatible with certain version updates of windows. These issues have been documented online and in Lenovo's forums.
"Lenovo charged me twice for my order. They did not apologize, explained that they have the authority to do this as it is their policy (I unsuccessfully tried to explain to several Indians that it is an illegal policy in the US.) I tried to resolve it with their online chat, but they weren't helpful then started harassing me after apparently releasing my answers to a satisfaction survey along with my personal email to the agent. I'm honestly kind of grateful that I can sever my relationship with Lenovo with only a week-long headache. I cannot imagine how terrible their customer service is when you've already purchased their machine. I will never even consider using a Lenovo ever again. No computer could ever be good enough to make up for such atrocious customer service."
Very bad dealing with customers. My laptop having a complaint. A daily working of 12-14 hours is there with my laptop. I bought this only before 7 months. It's body got damaged near one of its hinges and also a budging above the battery. From last two weeks it is with the service centre. They are now also informing that the approval from Lenovo company still not obtained and they can do nothing unless they gets any approval. From 26th of June to till date I can't able to clear the complaint from service centre. Very very poor dealing from company and very low quality laptops.
"Lenovo 21""all in one PC - Purchased to replace old HP desktop. Very sharp picture quality, easy to setup since it talks to you & guides you through setup. Easy to install needed apps. Very good price. Would definitely recommend!"
"We purchased the Yoga Book in 2017. In less than a year it was time to purchase a new EMR pen in which they discontinued already causing a new purchase of computer so that my daughter could continue her digital art. NONE of their customer service is available to assist. This is a brand new product with no plans to assist their customer base or repairs. Do not purchase this product, find another company to do your business with as the only thing they are businessing on is your pocketbook."
"I'm writing this review after a recent experience with Lenovo's repair team. A few weeks ago, I spilled (accidentally) some tea on my laptop (Thinkpad). Although the computer was working fine, the keyboard had gotten sticky and that made it difficult for me to type. After calling and arranging a repair, I sent my laptop to the Repair Depot on Friday afternoon and got it back with a completely new keep board - three days later - on Monday. Get that warranty, ya'll! Thank you Lenovo for your professionalism and quick service!"
"I purchased a Lenovo Think Pad. Just after the warranty expired I sent the computer to the company for repairs. It took over 2 months to get the computer back. Now less than 1 year later, the ""new"" battery that they installed will not hold a charge. The repairs are only warrantied for 90 days. Seems like a new battery should last at least a year and that the company should replace it. Spoke to a manager and although he was sympathetic there was nothing he could (would) do. Never buying a Lenovo product again."
I attempted a simple return of a part. Phone calls didn't work. Live chat didn't work. Twitter worked... sort of. Took 4 hours on Twitter to get a case number. Now I have to wait several days for an email with instructions. Will NEVER buy from Lenovo again. Ever.
"I thought dealing with cable companies were bad, these people must have taught them. Between 2 phone calls I spent 5 hours on the phone. Even though they all speak very broken English they make sure you know that you’re talking to Atlanta Georgia. When you ask for a supervisor you get put on hold for 20 minutes. I timed it each time after 10 minutes they come back and try to talk you out of talking to a supervisor. As it turns out I believe they're just trying to get you to hang up."
"After several technical problems and a new hard drive, Lenovo is demanding I repurchase operating system although I already purchased and paid for it when I purchased the laptop. Stay away from this company... They are a rip off and very poor quality. You will lose your mind dealing with their customer service dept on all levels."
"I reached out to Lenovo on Facebook when the tablet (Tab 10) I had gotten for my previous birthday (14 months ago) suddenly quit connecting to Wifi. After a long and arduous ""conversation"" with many a customer service agent (they even had me download a program that I ended up not needing to download), one finally told me that the wireless card appeared to be out. That information could have been gleaned from our first conversation. They then told me they would not fix it, that I should have purchased an extended warranty. Why are their products breaking randomly after just over a year? Why did I receive poor, unknowledgeable customer service?"
I will NEVER buy another Lenovo computer. I bought 2 Lenovo computers from Costco several years ago. One is a G500S touch and the other is an S415 touch. The S415 is difficult to use because the smaller screen does not show all of the website page no matter what settings you use. The G500S performs well but the case is total junk. The lid/screen cracked just from opening and closing and the back cover is literally falling apart. I have never handled the computer roughly. The material in the case is just too flimsy to hold up.
"Less than 2 month my new Lenovo laptop have vital failures. They had me ship it to their service center on my coast, it was the HDD running at a %100 usage while no foreground app running. Then got it back 10 days later with the same problems. After new HDD and a fresh installation of windows and the same problem. Now I got to ship it back again for another 10 days. I need my computer. I can’t just be without it. I even told the customer service rep I will be giving them a bad review on social media With NO appeasements from them what so ever. It’s like they don’t even care, all she said OK. What kind of technicians don’t check their work to see if the problem is fixed??? Really not impressed."
"I received my Lenovo (IdeaPad 110) for Christmas in 2016. It appears to be a very good laptop; but I don't get to use it much due to my work schedule. The one thing that has made me want to throw it in the garbage is the keyboard. The Right Shift key is out of place for typing something consistently. The UP arrow key is where the Right Shift key should be. I am sending this review from my old (received for Christmas in 2009 Acer Aspire 5532, which I might add has been and still is a wonderful laptop.) If I worked from home, I would not be able to use the Lenovo because of the misplacement of the shift key. I don't know if my Lenovo is just a freak or if all Lenovos have this same weird feature."
I feel Lenovo is still the best laptop computer for the money and still the best kept secret when it comes to mobile computing needs. And I will still take an 8-year old Lenovo laptop over any other brand's new laptop any day!
"If I could give them zero stars, I definitely would. I have a Yoga 910 after few months I needed to send it for repair for the first time. The second problem showed up after about a year. The battery stopped charging out of blue and when I called them, I was told the motherboard has a problem and they will send somebody to fix it and replace the battery and the motherboard! After waiting for about a week, Lenovo technician came to my place and screwed up the whole laptop! None of the ports were working, the sound card could not work, the screen was flickering and when I shut it down, I could not even turn it on again because the power board was not working either!!!"
"I have NEVER had a laptop like this in my life! I have had HP's, Dell's, Toshibas' etc. and this is unbelievable. It's hard to describe what it does, but I will try. If I go to a site, it knocks it off, if I try & uninstall the touchpad, it's still on, I didn't want a PW to get on my laptop, it makes me, I cannot go to any websites without shutting down all others. I got this laptop Ideapad last Nov. 2017 but didn't use it right away. All I do is try & fix it, so I have no time to actually be on my computer. What a piece of junk."
"I liked this computer. It is durable, easy to use and the cost was reasonable. The computer was easy to learn how to use the options on it. Also, the customer support is really good."
"I have purchased this Lenovo (Yoga) 710 series on February 25, 2018 from Lenovo exclusive store Jail Road, New Delhi. It has been a month. I have formatted my laptop twice and thrice not within a span of one month. On March 9, 2018 I raised a request regarding laptop hang issue, windows being automatically shut down after opening. The problem was resolved by Lenovo customer service team there afterwards. Now from past 2-3 days I am facing the same issue of hang and windows being drizzle some lines are coming. A pop was coming for this issue of support in blue screen and percentage span of 0%-100 % and laptop is being restarted automatically without being doing anything. So for this issue I formatted my laptop again on 18 Feb, 2018 but the problem is still persisting of hang and some kind of lines are coming."
"I use my Lenovo laptop mainly to download my video camera and make DVD's. Also, at times use it to watch YouTube. I have been very satisfied with its operation."
"Always had IBM/Lenovo. Long-lasting, easily upgraded when needed. Most of the computers I've purchased have been refurbished. I've used other computers, HP and Dell, and there's no comparison for me."
"I bought an IdeaPad laptop, couldn't wait for it to come although I have several devices that I use as I work from home. Right at setup I can't connect to the WiFi and I don't know why, key correct other devices connect and disconnect. Spend several hours think it may just be an issue with the setup but with all suggestions nothing worked. I arranged a call and support called me back but no one was there, I called them and right away when I explained the problem the women said, ""You need to contact your ISP!"" Why would I have to contact my ISP to connect a laptop to my network? That is just ridiculous! If this is a known problem why is there nothing in the box to say, ""Hey: FYI you might need to contact your ISP (for what I don't know) because our piece of junk WiFi adapter may not connect to your network!"" What good is a laptop that cannot connect to the WiFi, returning it as defective."
"After a fair bit of research, I decided to purchase a 'loaded' Yoga 720 and placed an order Mar 6th, only after an extended call with support because initially the order wouldn't go through. Not to worry he said, ""I will look after it"" - even offered his email for followup. He said it was the active pen that was on backorder, but the laptop was no problem."
"Purchased a Lenovo laptop for my son a year ago. Completely unreliable. Very little done on the laptop other than Word Documents. Laptop will not turn on. Lenovo could do nothing as the product wouldn't turn on to assess. Local computer repair store could do nothing more. Lenovo's suggestion... ""We can help you buy a new one."" Not a great suggestion. Don't ever buy cheap because you get what you pay for and $350 gets you Lenovo garbage."
IdeaCentre computer is a piece of garbage. This is an i7 and works as an i3. Do not buy this Lenovo product. I would suggest any other brand than Lenovo. Tech Support is like calling Starbucks. Terrible service and terrible product.
I have the T430 and it is durable yet light for its size. A workhorse. The mouse pad has a very light touch no need to bang on it. Same with the keyboard.
It's faster than I really thought. Better and more program than I thought to begin with. Fantastic choices. Well worth the trouble of getting this. You get really good speed and at least one Terabyte of storage. Good quality build and name.
"The big problem with the Lenovo Yoga 2 laptop I purchased is the Win8 operating system. It is not nearly as good as Win7, especially the search function. I still use a lot of programs for which there is no app to do the things that I want. These programs are some of the same ones that I used on Win7."
"I have bought Lenovo IdeaPad U330 Touch which hardware fall apart after one year and few months. Of course, there are no parts available anymore and after holding my laptop for two months ""waiting"" for the parts to come they sent it back without any explanation (I had to request it additionally). 800 € laptop under guarantee. TERRIBLE hardware and horrible service. The monitor de-attached with the keyboard."
"I bought a Lenovo Ideapad 700 about 1.5 years ago from adorama.com, with a 1TB HDD and 256GB SSD, with Windows 10 Home pre-installed on the SSD. It started randomly freezing/crashing (like a couple of times a day) on the first day I started using the machine. I searched everywhere and tried a lot of things, but couldn't resolve the random freezing issue. After several chats with Lenovo tech support, I decided to send in the machine to their repair center in Kentucky with $35 out-of-pocket. I wrote a note to explicitly mention that I re-installed the Windows several times and didn't resolve it. A couple of weeks later I received the machine back, and it still had the random freezing issue. I found their repair note mentioned that the only thing they did was re-installing the Windows."
"My husband and I decided it was time to update our PCs. We went to Best Buy. After looking at them for awhile a salesman said he recommended the Lenovo. That it was used in their store. We ended up buying two desktops. That was Feb of 16. They were fair. Slow loading, froze up a lot. Would be in the middle of doing something and it either froze or took you somewhere else. Finally this Feb. we had a 2 year warranty I try to get on my pc and the arrow is nowhere to be found. Cannot get off of the sign in page. Tried everything."
"I purchased an IdeaPad 710S Plus, and I loved it. On day 4, while opening the laptop lid, the pad of my thumb cracked the screen! I have been using laptops since 1999, I never had this problem... There is absolutely no other way of opening this laptop - you have to touch and apply pressure on the screen. I called tech support, got a service order created, and sent the unit via FedEx paying a lot of money for the package and shipment. I received an email saying ""damage that is not covered under your device's Limited Warranty. You will soon be contacted by one of our depot associates to further discuss the billable details"". It has been more than a week, nobody has contacted me. When I call to ask for status, they say ""someone will call you within 3 business days"". I wish I had not purchased this laptop... $800 totally wasted."
"I went from a laptop I3 to the ""Lenovo"" I7 and was told that this computer was lightning fast. This computer is SUPER SLOW and is comparable to the I3. I am a first-time Lenovo buyer, and WILL NEVER BUY A Lenovo PRODUCT AGAIN. WARNING: do yourself a favor and buy another brand. Lenovo is a complete disappointment. Has already crashed after about, oh, 1 week of usage. Lenovo, why don't you hire competent developers for your computers? I am going back to ASUS. You guys are incompetent. Learn how to speak English -- losers."
"After spending over $2,000 on my 6th Gen X1 Carbon ThinkPad, I really like the computer; however, I called tech support to resolve the simple issue of reversing the function keys so I can use the ""F1, F2, etc"" keys without hitting the function key to be able to use them. This should take anyone with knowledge of computers mere seconds to switch. I was disconnected from the main support number 3 times. I then finally got through to hardware support. The first person simply hung up on me after telling me it wasn't a hardware support issue, it was software. She said I obviously didn't understand the difference and hung up on me. Called software support. They said it was a hardware support and they could not help me. After 1 hour and 40 minutes trying to get this resolved, I simply gave up. I will be returning the computer I really like because the support is so poor."
"THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE! Do not deal with Lenovo! You would not have any customer service with them! They just do not care! They will take your money and then you call them! Waste hours! Try to get an answer! You will get harassed by their online representatives!! You will get nowhere! For 3 hours! They have no rules! Good luck with your Lenovo Purchase! Enjoy the Zero you will be paying for! Guys, take your money elsewhere!"
"My experience with Lenovo's technical support team was nothing short of inadequate. My Lenovo Ideapad Flex 4 recently had a software update & after updating the laptop, I fell victim to the popular Windows Security login issue while trying to login to my campus wifi (I'm a college student). During the phone call, I explained my dilemma & after asking the technician if he could explain to me what the problem was, he said something to the effect of, ""I know what the problem is but the only way to solve it is for you to pay a fee of $99 so I may transfer you to a ""specialized technician."" Any astute person would like to understand the problem before spending this kind of money on a solution, so after explaining that to him, I told the technician I wasn't willing to make that payment and he hang up. That is clearly 1 star quality."
"I purchased this laptop (Ideapad 310) last March for the sole purpose of running Quickbooks at my office. It has performed flawlessly until last week when it overheated. Sent to Lenovo by UPS on 2/13/18 and received back via UPS on 2/21/18. Repaired quickly under warranty and appears to be working again. It has several features that I like; SD card holder, 2 usb ports and cd drive. For $400.00, I felt it was a good buy. Have been very happy with my first laptop."
"Received Lenovo 910 laptop on Nov 24, 2017. It's being repaired for the 3rd time... I still don't have it back yet. It's now Feb 17, 2018 and a replacement part won't be available until Feb 24, 2018. Lenovo wouldn't replace the laptop because I opted to have them repair it the first time and the repair took it past the 1-month replacement period. Needless to say... I won't buy Lenovo again."
"Lenovo's customer service is very poor. 4 days ago they let someone order 2 laptops with my debit card. Overdrafting my account over $1500. UPS has intervened and is sending them back, but they refuse to refund my money until they receive them and then it could take 7-10 days to get my money. They keep telling me it's their policy. I guess they have a lot of fraudulent charges. They need to be like Apple, when someone makes a big purchase to call them and verify it. I never have and never will consider buying a computer from them. Ridiculous."
The speaker you can't even watch a movie because you can't hear it. It very frustrating. I have to pick up the laptop put it by my ear to hear. I hate that. I would not have bought this. I didn't know it has no SD slot. I am very disappointed.
I purchased a $5000 Lenovo Workstation: P910 December 2017. 30 days later while adding a new SSD I found the internal SSD holder was cracked and unusable. Lenovo support was rude and indifferent to my concern. Lenovo refused to replace the damaged part ($12 cheap plastic) under warranty. Apparently Lenovo does not value its retail customers as they do their business customers.
"My laptop crashed right after dropping in on the ground and I needed something quick and inexpensive so I went to Best Buy and without reviewing the product I bought this IdeaPad. Trouble right from the beginning. But to spare the details the main problem is storage space. I am always getting messages that my storage is full and I haven't even downloaded any apps. I can't scroll on Facebook but only about 10 minutes before the computer stops loading pictures, will not scroll and I have to close the app. I haven't even started using the office apps yet. At times the computer just freezes. This is all within a month. I do not recommend this computer to anyone."
"Bought a Lenovo Yoga in November 2016, by January 2017, it had totally shut down. Returned it and they fixed it. But in November 2017 again total shutdown. Tried to talk to them but all they would do was, ""Send it in and we will check it,"" but this time out of warranty. After 2 weeks we received email informing us that since it was out of warranty it would cost $540 to fix. We already spent $1200 to buy it and now broken for the second time we said no! Very poor customer service, for the price very poor! Stay away from Lenovo."
"Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 14 looks solid but after 3 years of use, I had to replace the hard drive and now the hinges are starting to break down. After researching it, it appears hinge issue is ongoing - a latent defect? It cost about a month $100.00 for the parts and $100 labor. After spending $300 to replace the HD, spending more $ to keep it seems like throwing good money after bad. (Ever see a $1000 Laptop held together with rubber band to keep it closed?) Next time I will read these Consumer Affairs review carefully BEFORE I make a decision. Shame on me. No more Lenovo for me."
"I bought a Think Pad X1 Tablet from Lenovo directly. My son was using an old Lenovo ThinkPad laptop I had at home. My son is 14 years old. He needed it for school. He was so excited... until we received the tablet broke. He was heartbroken. I was too. Then we returned it to Lenovo and surprise...when we received the 2nd computer it came defective too! Lenovo received the computer at North Carolina (return label address) on January 20th. Still today (February 1st, 2018) I have not received my credit card credit for the amount they charged back on January 9. Called Lenovo today. The very nice lady that took care of my complaint was very apologetic but I don't think she realized the damage and how much Lenovo can affect the illusion and excitement of young kids! Hope that none of you have to go through this kind of situation."
"Ideacentre 310s broke in 3 weeks. Hard drive is clearly defective, all my files are lost. This computer is garbage and even if they repair it, I know now that the replacement parts are still garbage. How am I suppose to use a computer that could at any second, for no reason, die and lose all my files? What good is that? I spent hours on the phone being shuffled between tech support and customer service to no avail. I want a refund."
"Bought this machine (Lenovo 720 laptop) in May, 2017. Had to turn it in for a complete repair (the hard drive was making a ""grinding"" noise). In November, 2017 I experienced a problem with the WiFi adaptor. After several calls to tech support, that was repaired. In January, 2018, had additional problem connecting to WiFi. Was told to uninstall the WiFi adapter by Lenovo tech support, and had difficulty restoring the WiFi adapter. I was then told that there might be a problem with the Windows configuration and was instructed to perform a System Restore going back about 1 month earlier, well before the problems started."
"Lenovo company is the worst company as the customer service they provide is the worst ever. They are not responding to my complaints, got the worst product Lenovo Ideapad 310. The laptop is defective one and their terms and conditions are the worst."
"I purchased a Lenovo Edge 2 laptop about 2 years ago. Last week, one of the hinges broke and the top screen came apart when I closed the laptop. I called Lenovo warranty and they said they cannot help me because it is beyond the 1 year warranty period. I explained it's not a warranty issue but a manufacturer's defective part or parts. They continued to state like programmed robots that they could not help me because it's beyond the warranty period. I have other laptops and none came apart on me like this laptop. Very disappointed Lenovo does not stand by their products."
"Had multiple product in my workplace. (The Yoga 510, IdeaPad U330p, G50) Misleading overrated specs, but I discover few of our Lenovo mainly Lenovo backgrounds are mainly causing the laptop run sluggish. Takes long time to start / open / close program. Wonder how people in media rate them best brand. They are one of weaker support. Even our Samsung RC510 run faster than U330p."
Lenovo has had my computer for a month now. Every time I call I get the same runaround. They say they will expedite the repair & return shipping. Same story all the time. Most awful service and people who do not care. I will NEVER buy another Lenovo product.
"I've had at least 8 different tech people, charge me for their time, try to repair it, and a day or so later, the problem returns. I give up. My thinking is that the computer's color is actually ""yellow,'' even if the color is not visible. Very frustrating experience. I wish I could turn it into lemon juice but, that unfortunately, isn't an option. I'm stuck and that is that. Guess who isn't going to buy another Lenovo... ever again?"
"Lenovo P40 Yoga computer purchased new 4/2016. Extended warranty with 24hr on-site service plan purchased 4/2017. November 2017, computer failed to boot up after power down/restart. Called tech support under warranty service, who diagnosed this as a system board failure. Tech support said that part was in stock, and would be delivered to the technician whom will provide on-site repair on the second business day following my call. I called to check status on the morning of the expected service, and was told that the part is on ""back order"" and not available until March 2018. I asked if they can provide me with a new computer, in keeping with the ""next business day"" warranty and they offered no help or solutions. They forwarded me to sales dept, who forwarded me to another tech service department, and then to service center in India. Absolutely worthless, and wasted nearly 3 hours of my time on hold/transfers/disconnects, etc."
"Worst laptop I have ever owned. I have had problems with Lenovo Yoga 3 since the first day. When I turned it on for the first time I had ghost touches. I found the patch and fixed it myself. Then my wifi kept getting disconnected, so I had to update the driver. It somewhat fixed the problem, but not completely. Then dead pixels in the screen a couple months later. The charger had a short since the first day. I had to replace the charger. Now the screen just went out. My god this is the worst laptop I have ever owned. It cost nearly 900 dollars. What a joke!!! I will never buy a Lenovo computer again!!!"
"Great laptop. Fabulous performance and has all I need, longevity, able to add storage, maintenance is simple, set up is easy, and great service if I have a problem."
"I normally use a desktop PC, but since my son punched mine I have used my cell phone. Never thought of getting a laptop until I saw this Lenovo on sale. I like it."
"When I forgot my swipe code, I had to reset the tablet. The Lenovo 10 Tab software kept throwing my login into a loop asking to put the original Google account associated with the account in to verify my account. It failed to work. After over 4 hours on the phone with Google and Lenovo tech support, Lenovo wanted to charge me $39 to have them help me. The tablet only cost $99.00. They said it was either a glitch or possibly a virus, even though I had only used it a few times. I had tried other times to get their help on this issue with no success; at least another 10 hours. I cannot believe this company would not back their product without charging!"
Very sturdy machine. Tough. Buy it. Use it. Feel the difference. The large screen helps in better visibility too. The sturdy top makes it good against damage.
"Easy to use and set up. I always use a desktop opposed to a tablet or laptop. I'm a senior citizen, however, I'm pretty computer savvy and literate. Great help if you need it."
In June of 2016 I bought a Lenovo computer. It has now been sent back to the company for repair for the third time in 15 months. This company keeps sending it back not fixed because the same problem keeps happening. This is a lemon and the company has still not committed to fixing it. All I want is a computer that works when I turn it on. I would NEVER RECOMMEND this computer or COMPANY to any other business's or friends. They have had me without a computer for several weeks over this time period. I had a Toshiba for many years without a problem. It was just time to update. I wish I had not listened to the sale person and bought another Toshiba. If I could rate this company zero stars I would.
The Lenovo laptop is a very good computer for the cost. I just replaced a computer that crashed and am still learning the details of the operations of the Lenovo.
"Spoke with 3 customer service people. All had no information on my laptop getting fixed. Couldn't even find it in the system, had to ask them to repeat everything multiple times as their English is so broken. Not helpful, left frustrated and with no answers! What a complete waste of time. Will never go back to this company or recommend them to anyone."
"Bought a Lenovo laptop through Best Buy a year ago. Selling point was it was formerly IBM. Mother board failed after 1 year. Sent in computer a month ago for repair and was told that part was on order with an ""indefinite"" delivery date. After 3 weeks finally told one more week until delivery of part. 2 days ago told it would be another month. Tried going through customer service to Escalation Department and was denied to talk to them because they have ""3 business days"" to call me back. Shouldn't waiting a month count for actually getting to TALK with a supervisor??? I feel like I'm being held hostage with a $1000 computer at their disposal with no resolution in sight. DON'T BUY LENOVO!!!"
"It's been 1 month now. My machine is broke down, and no results. I keep calling this number and it still no respond. I got like 50 apologize the last month, but is not enough to make me happy. Right now I'm not mad but, I'm very sad, because the only entertainment I got is the internet. I feel happy for them, they don't have to go through all the things that I went through the last month. I'm a businessman 40 years in the business, I got retail and wholesale business back then, I had one incorporation and one LLC. No one never ever unhappy with my business. I'm always resolve the problem 24 hours, that's a fact. I never playing ""hiding in the bush"", its a fact too. Now I don't know what can I do, if anybody knows who can I call, or anything about this issue please let me know. I appreciate it. TY. God bless."
"I have used Lenovo products for many years, overall, I am quite a satisfied customer. My current computer is a Yoga 910, works extremely well, versatile (laptop - tablet), and definitely meets my needs."
I have a laptop and use it every day. The Lenovo has been reliable and easy to use. It has a lot more functions than what I use. My computer geek husband enjoys using too.
I'm using Lenovo laptops for my portable Lightroom computers when I travel. They're lightweight with great performance and I like the retracting keyboard when you fold them into a tablet configuration. I end up editing a lot of my pictures before I get back home as they have such great screens.
"I have used Lenovo for some time. They are cost effective, I have had a few problems which were frustrating but customer service helped. The IT company I often use has recommended Lenovo to me in the past."
"I purchased my Lenovo laptop in April, 2017. I rarely use it, because each time I turn on the computer, I am inundated with forced (I do not select them) downloads/apps, etc., which typically take 15 to 20 minutes, before I can begin to log on. I am concerned mostly, about the security aspect of my laptop. I do not feel confident to use it to pay bills, to do my banking, or anything else that may require exposure of critical, personal information. I actually prefer using my cellphone for everything, rather than try to navigate through the nightmare Lenovo experience. I appreciate your time reviewing my review/concerns."
"Customer service has no clue. I called at least (20) times. Sometimes calls get dropped but one thing they are consistent with is having no idea where my laptop is or if it’s fixed. I have the reference number and an e-mail confirming they received the unit. I will never buy a Lenovo product for myself, my family or my business ever again. Lenovo’s customer service and ability to follow through are the worst I have ever experienced with a company."
"We purchased the Lenovo E470 Laptop August 28, 2017. Shortly after purchasing the computer I could not use it because lines were populating the page. I called their customer care line several times. Eventually I was told the problem would be escalated. I finally talked to a representative who was knowledgeable. The calls are handled by a call center who Lenovo contracts with. He gain access to my computer and attempted to update the driver(s). That did not work. He later said engineers are working on a solution. The problem has been escalated."
"I have begged and pleaded for assist, one day after writing a bad review, someone actually responded to me by saying, ""Ok you got my attention""... and then stopped responding again. Their salespeople sell you then aren't ever heard from again, they don't follow up at all. My computer is now about 4 months old and they want me to pay to update drivers... really. I didn't buy a refurbished unit. It was new. How dare they. Awful awful awful... IBM>>>Where are you???"
"Sharing experience nothing else. Bought Lenovo ThinkPad E450 and purchased 3 yr extended onsite warranty from Lenovo... Now my after 1 and half year my battery is not working. And I called customer care for this meanwhile today and the guy was like, ""You tell them, mail them to our another team,"" blah... Blah. And the person say, ""Your warranty does not have battery Coverage."" Now I have like 3 pages of bill. There it doesn't say anywhere about this battery scene. Super annoyed with Lenovo and their poor and fake service... Strictly recommend don't buy!!"
I bought a Lenovo All in One on March 2016 and called tech support in June 2017 as it wouldn't turn on at all. I was asked if I had damaged or dropped the All in One Desktop that I use for my business and leave on my desk at work. Had to send copy of receipt because they needed proof of purchase. They sent a tech out who couldn't fix it. Told me to send it in and I did. 3 weeks went by and they said the part was on backorder. Waited two more weeks and called tech support and they said they would send me another computer. I received it June 2017.
"My Lenovo Ideapad 100S is 3 DAYS old. Touch pad not working. In another state past 3 days. Cannot work. It is absolutely worthless. I am sending this thing back! Looked at the forums, tried the fixes. Nada. Not messing around with this anymore. Thank goodness it's new and returnable. No more of ANYTHING Lenovo makes."
"I've had the worst customer service experience of my life with Lenovo. Purchased a Lenovo ThinkCentre M800 in May 2017 In September 2017, the hard drive crashed. After a week of dealing with Lenovo customer service I've gotten nowhere. They refuse to repair the machine. They will only send a part which is currently on backorder. I've spend hours being transferred and placed on hold and not once has anyone actually been able to help me resolve the issue. I will NEVER buy a Lenovo product again."
"I bought a Lenovo Yoga 2 11 Laptop for my daughter for college in June 2016. 1 year later in June 2017, the laptop would not turn on at all. She took it in to see what could be done. They wanted $400.00 for a new Motherboard so I called Lenovo direct because I thought for sure they would agree (I was so wrong) that their laptop should not last only 1 year and for me to spend $400.00 1 year later after spending approximately $800.00 on it then seemed ridiculous."
"Lenovo Tab 2 10Inch 16 GB Tablet - Purchased thru AMAZON. Received it in May of 2016. It dies in June of 2016. Returned it to their Louisville repair center with all the proper paperwork. Received it back in August of 2016. It died again in December of 2016. Again, returned it to their Louisville repair center with all the proper paperwork. Received it back in May of 2017 (you read right, took nearly 6 months to repair). Now here I sit in July of 2017 and it dies again. Contacted Lenovo and they said (Sooo sorry) ""After review of your **, requesting an out of warranty repair, Lenovo's Corporate policy does not allow OOW repairs at no charge. As the machine has been out of warranty since 6/16/2017, I do apologize, I will not be able to approve this request."""
"I have 2 Lenovo computers, first was a desktop. Ran slow from the start. Gave it to my Grandson, crashed every time he'd try playing a game, I bought a new laptop not realizing it was a Lenovo, wanted a bigger screen than my iPad was. Just going to use it for Netflix checking email & such, again slow loading, constantly crashing, turned it on earlier. Put on Netflix, watch for 5 minutes, the screen goes black, check power cord etc. Now it won't even turn on. Keep in mind I had only owned both computer a matter of days before problems ensued. NEVER, EVER, AGAIN, & if I'm asked for an opinion on a new computer will reply, anything BUT a Lenovo."
"I purchase a Lenovo Ideapad 310-15ISK and after five months of normal use it starts failing. Performance was bad, slow, unresponsive and not able to log in to web pages. CPU and disc drive working at 100% when idle or only 1 browser was open. Was used for school work to login into books to do class and homework. I send it twice to repair to NC Depot Lenovo tech support and it came back with the same problems. At the Lenovo repair depot they only did a factory system reset and update the drivers (software touch ups), which did not solve the hardware problem it has."
"This is far and away the worst computer I've ever had the misfortune to use. The Lenovo IdeaPad 110 processor is incredibly slow, the loaded software does not work, you cannot disable any of the startup processes. The keyboard is so stupidly designed that it's an exercise in frustration to try to compose a grammatically coherent document. Seriously, who puts the page up key in the position that on every other keyboard known to man is the SHIFT key? And why even have an end key if it doesn't take you to the end of the line of text?"
"I ordered a Yoga 720 on June 30, 2017 where it estimated delivery to be within 2 weeks. After two weeks, their online tracker said it would ship on July 31st and wouldn't get here until August 7th which is a WHOLE MONTH after I ordered it. I called them THREE times and each time they assured me that it would be shipped on the 17th, this is very important since I am moving from my address to another state on July 25."
I purchase my first and only Lenovo in 9/2016. It has had very limited use since I've purchased it. Since I started using my new computer it has been slow. Not running games or streaming videos off the internet. Pulling up basic files and documents take an excessive amount of time. I tried returning it today for a refund but no luck. I will give it to my mom to browse Facebook but I feel guilty because I know it will be slow even doing that. Poor mom.
"I have been ""typing"" on a keyboard of one kind or another for 50 years. Never have I run across a format where the right-hand shift key is so misplaced. I am a writer, and I have tried to adjust to the change, but every time I try to use it in the course of writing, I hit the UP arrow key and my cursor flies up to another line. This interrupts my writing entirely, as I have to replace my cursor, sometimes delete the text that's appeared in the wrong line and resume my train of thought. There is no other computer that has the right-hand shift key in this position. I tried to ""reassign"" the keys, but the position is hard-wired and can't be changed. This is affecting my work and I want to return the machine. NOT HAPPY AT ALL with what appears to be an arbitrary design change."
I am using Lenovo T510 model. Cost me over 1000$. Now I want to restore the operating system and drivers are missing. I tried to find drivers online but look like lenovo are not supporting their own products. https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/my/en/regemail - broken link. http://support.lenovo.com/ - broken link.
"I bought a Lenovo ThinkPad 510 with DVD drive. The drawer quit opening while under warranty. I was given a link to find a ""nearby"" authorized repair center. I found some 150-200 miles away. I called to see if any were closer and was told for Consumer products (not owned by businesses), there is literally one in the USA. I have to pay to send it in (it's heavy), take photos in case they damage it, fill out a LOT of paperwork."
"I bought a Lenovo Yoga. It was a lemon -- the hard drive crapped out before a year was out. It gave me a lot of headaches while it was crapping out. I've heard that others have had customer service problems with Lenovo. Fortunately, Geek Squad is expediting the repair. I've never bought a computer lemon before -- CURSE YOU, LENOVO!"
"When I bought a Lenovo YOGA Tab 3 in London on the 1st of June 2017, I was assured by the guy behind the till that it carried an international warranty. ""All Lenovo products do, just keep the slip"". So, I believed him and bought it. I traveled to the USA prior to my return to South Africa. On the 12th of June (1.5 weeks later) my tablet screen froze."
"My Lenovo was purchased December 12, 2016. By January when it was plugged in, it started to lose its charge. When it wasn't plugged in and was used the charge went down quickly. Called the Tech support and they couldn't help. They told me to take it to Best Buy. They couldn't help said it was probably the battery. Called Tech support again and they said send it to them. They send me a box. Sent it in April 2nd and they had it until May 9th. The same thing happened again."
"I had some discoloration on my screen, so I called Lenovo for tech support. However, they told me that the part that they needed was on back order. I waited patiently for a month or two, and still got nothing, and when I called to ask when the part would be available, they couldn't even give me an estimate. Then one of the technicians called me to let me know that he was coming over to fix my computer, and I was initially ecstatic that it was finally going to get done. However, he didn't show up on the day that we scheduled him to come over. When I called Lenovo regarding this, they said that my part was still in back order."
To say their service is horrible is an insult to horrible. First I bought in April of 2013 a Lenovo Y400. The sales pitch was dual video cards. They then proceeded to not make the dual video from the DVD slot. I got an issue with reinstall via the UEFI bios to get a complete restore disk I had to buy a service plan for 69 bucks which I could cancel. 69 bucks for a restore disk? I had same issue with the U310. Again I had to buy a separate plan for them. I found a backdoor to fix the issue minus their dual 69 dollar plans.
"Lenovo is the worst!!! I've sent my laptop back 4 different times for the same exact problem, only for it to be sent back with the same problem. This is the fourth time I'm getting my computer sent back to me. I've had it back for 42 hours now and it took less than two days for it to completely crash yet again. The computer just shuts off and it will not turn back on no matter what steps I try to take. I am so sick of them and I pray they are shut down after reading all the reviews on it!!! Thanks Lenovo for stealing my money since your product sucks."
"I purchased a Lenovo desktop computer from large local computer company in 2016. After 6 months old the touch screen was acting strange, the mouse was non compliant, the screen was expanding and making the desktop impossible to use. So not thinking anything we disconnected the screen. Continued to use the computer with no issues. 8 months later we updated after returning from abroad. The computer then turned on the touch screen and made it impossible to use the computer."
"It’s a 2-1, so you can put it in tablet mode parrot in either mode the touchscreen doesn't work at all. After 4 hours with their tech support doing remedial support options, we ended up doing a full restore of the computer from scratch to factory. Again didn't solve the issue. Called today they started going through the same nonsense and wanted me to email the proof of purchase even though we had just registered the serial number and I said I want to talk to a supervisor I'm done with this. And he continued with his call log if you will. And I just said “Look I don't mean to be mean but I don't want to talk to you anymore, get a supervisor.” They weren't any better. So rather than deal with this horrible company I'm just returning the laptop. Which is a shame because when functioning is Best in Class."
"Dear Lenovo, The last offer to which I have preferred is death to visit your service centre and deal with your over arrogant and negligent staff. They are so rude that anyone with low temperament could have slapped them easily. There are labyrinth of terms and conditions which cause customer service deterioration. I have a Motorola mobile phone motoG3 Turbo edition, which fell prey to some malfunctioning of charging. I visited service centre, first they examined the problem and told me abruptly to leave my phone for a month. Just for smaller charging problems. Holy **! Then after one guy came and he denied submitting the since it was tampered with."
"I bought this computer not even a year ago and it ran perfect for three months. I though, ""Wow, a good price and a great computer!"" Yeah it is too good to be true. I do not use Facebook or any other websites on this computer. It is strictly for school so that I DON'T have issues. Well the mouse pad likes to do its own thing and constantly zoom in and zoom out, open my start button, open documents like I'm uploading, instead of going backwards when I hit the backspace. It's acting like a tab button. Very frustrating when you're trying to get your homework done and you're already on a time limit and your computer wants to be a jackass. DONE WITH YOU LENOVO. SUCK A ** OR HIRE BETTER ENGINEERS."
"In August of 2016, I purchased a brand new Lenovo Thinkpad 460s for around $1000.00. Since August, I have sent the laptop for repairs 3 times for the same problem: the power button lights up but the screen remains blank. The first time I called customer service in November of 2016, I was told to bring the laptop to an authorized dealer in my area for repair. So I did. In January, I had the same problem again. This time, I sent the laptop directly to Lenovo for repair. In May, the same problem happened for the third time. I decided that this laptop must be a ""lemon"" and asked for a replacement. I was told that even though it has broken three times in less than 6 months, and I have a warranty, that it wasn't possible to get a replacement. So I sent the laptop back for the third time and was told that the case would be escalated. I was promised the laptop back in 5-6 days."
"What happened to Lenovo Depot Support! It's gone downhill really fast. It took me an hour on hold to talk to anyone. During the waiting, the automated voice said ""You can visit www.lenovo.com/depotstatus to get the status of the repair"". Well that takes you to the main, Lenovo website. Get your act together. Change the automated message. I have been purchasing Lenovo from the day they became Lenovo as one of their largest enterprise clients. We have 24 hr support on our computers. Always have had good, prompt service. Not now. One of our computers has been in the Depot for 2 months on a parts hold. The part is an SSD card (hard drive)! Really! You don't have hard drives to swap out at the Depot. It takes 2 months to get a hard drive! And, why is the email address to escalate the issue @us.ibm.com. Perhaps that explains the bad service."
"I bought an IdeaCentre 710 in early May from the online store. From the first click of the mouse, it literally (emphasis) started breaking... the mouse broke. Two days later the memory failed. Customer service (if it can really be called that) was a joke. They ignored my memory failure while focusing on some other minor detail they wanted to fix. After several calls and tests, they finally realized the memory failure was serious and wanted me to return it. I pressed to get the return authorization completed before the long Memorial Day weekend but they didn't care to help. They love to cite protocol as the reason for not moving fast on everything and so it didn't happen before the holiday. It took 10 days to get a replacement and the next PC failed on the first power up."
"I talked to at least 5 of their technicians, all of them were very rude! They did not hold back from saying racist remarks about me being an American. Also, I was billed 195$ AND THEY DID NOT EVEN FIX MY ISSUES!!! I am contacting my bank AND my lawyer! I hope you get shut down for such an awful call center. I cannot believe Lenovo will allow such things to happen to their customers!! I know they are located overseas and whoever is managing that sector needs to be FIRED! They do not teach their employees manners OR customer service!"
"I have to say I'm sorely disappointed with the small business sales division of this company. I've been thru 4 sales account representatives in less than 3 months. I just checked on an order I put in with a purchase order almost a month ago. Looks like it never made it thru the system. When I asked for a manager, I couldn't even get a telephone number to reach him. Needless to say, I'm sorely disappointed."
I bought brand new 1 week old Lenovo Ideapad 310-15KIB-80TV laptop and the fan will not stop running and the battery will not charge and I am always at work and can never get a hold of Lenovo customer support during the weekdays. This suck and in the evening time during the weekdays their phone system sucks. Never can get through to them to help me and their website is worthless for info on my problems.
"I certainly have had poor product quality experience with my Lenovo Laptop - enough to never purchase again (including a hard disk failure and failure to power on, but the support and extended warranty rates all time worst) - in my opinion, based on my personal experience. I do not understand how they can sell a warranty called ""next day on site business support"" (which I have for three years) and then have ""support down"", ""takes 5-7 days on average for someone to get out"", ""takes months to get parts from China"", etc. I am really surprised there has been some kind of government or consumer action for this type of marketing tactic. There is no one by phone to talk to, only a very vague escalation process which appears to be as bad as regular support."
HAVE E550 LESS THAN A YEAR - Headphone quit - I do a lot of music stuff - Keyboard quit working - NO SPILLS NO DROPS - JUST QUIT. They tried to say out of warranty. Sent copy of receipt 3 times before acknowledgment. Then they said ok updated. All is good. We are are going to fix it for free. I even bought an extended warranty because don't trust them. Absolute horrible communication between depts. Do not buy one. They try to weasel out of everything. I have only contacted the BBB once. I'm going to write to the Better Business Bureau about them. I'm Angry.
"I buy and sell a lot of electronics and Lenovo has to be one of the WORST companies I have ever dealt with!!! I tried placing an order for a $1000 laptop on a Friday. I had a coupon code that gave me an additional $75 off and it was applied to my online cart. When I tried ordering it online, my payment could not be processed and I did not have an option for expedited shipping. I tried calling Lenovo and the rep told me that they were having a lot of processing errors and that the expedited shipping just wasn't an option. He could not get my payment to go through over the phone, and then told me that I would just have to wait. I waited until Sunday and tried to place an online order and the $75 coupon code now wasn't able to be applied."
Lenovo has THE WORST customer service brushing up against other disastrous companies like Dell. Outsourced customer service reps who follow a script and repeat themselves until you hang up and take on the situation by yourself. Be smart: call the customer service line OF THE PRODUCT you want to buy because now Lenovo has IDEA pads (aka: Terrible-Service Pads) and THINK pads.
"I loaded Microsoft student on my new Y700 that the VA sent me and Excel will not work. I've tried un-installing it a number of times, just won't work. Confirmed for me what ""Lowest Bidder"" means when the government is involved."
"I purchased my U530 computer in September of 2014. It drops from the WiFi regularly which is annoying but, other than that, it had been a decent machine. Two weeks ago the hinge inexplicably broke when I started to close it. It has never been dropped or misused in any way so I documented the hinge and called customer service. Since I am beyond the warranty period they first stated that they could do nothing. When I pressed the issue and pointed out that I had found HUNDREDS of other customers on the internet whom had experienced the same issue they offered me contact with a case manager. The case manager offered a one time free repair, but to get the repair I have to agree to a contract which states that if they don't have the part, then they don't have to fix it and they will send it back unfixed."
"I purchased a Lenovo server new on October 31, 2016 from my local PC shop. Everything was good until February 14, 2017 when there was a surge in the power supply and the unit fried the motherboard. I took the unit back to the PC shop and the tech told me she would contact Lenovo for a warranty replacement since the unit was only 3 1/2 months old. When she had not received a response from Lenovo I called them, that's where things went sour... They informed me that the warranty had run out and they would not be doing anything to replace or repair the unit."
"I found this website deep into the Google search pages. I hope someone considering laptop purchase will read it. All the so-called computer mags give Yoga a hearty thumbs up. Not my experience in the least. After a year of use several keys are sticking. I use a wireless keyboard in the office. But when I go on the road the laptop keyboard sucks. Fan always runs on max speed. The audio jack now does not work. The power supply crackles and sizzles. The unit was one week out of Geek Squad extended warranty and I called Tech Support and got the typical gal from India who was very difficult to understand. Even though the power supply is now a fire hazard she couldn't care less. So, $50 for a new crappy power supply. Geek squad did not send a reminder to re-up my warranty. Guess they know that Yoga is a crappy machine."
"I bought a Lenovo laptop 2 years ago. It NEVER worked correctly from the get go. Constant issues with the start up and always getting stuck while trying to sign in... This laptop is low rate... It's junk. LeNOvo is a Big No in my opinion. I am going back to an HP or a Dell. Sincerely, Very Dissatisfied Customer."
I purchased Lenovo K6 Note on last week. From the beginning I have a microphone sound issue in this phone. When I'm in call my voice cannot hear by the other side (very low sound). I think the microphone voice sense is very low. This will happen for all calls. If any way to clear this issue pls help me.
"Lenovo ideapad 700 - I have some major complaints about the operating system. On numerous a occasions my system will throw an error code and want you to restart the system. There are times that the whole screen will go blank and you have to manually reboot by cutting the laptop off. Sometimes when you try to cut the computer on, it does not want to come on; meaning I have to hold down the on button for several seconds and even then I may need to do this several times before the system decides to come on. Very disappointed as this laptop is used for business. On a small note, a matter of opinion, I do not like the mouse pad divider meaning to the left you scroll and to the right you can open and close etc... Before you just right clicked twice. Will not make another purchase as these products are not cheap. Expectation letdown. :("
"Bought this computer June 2015 which I never used until Sept, 2016 because my Sony had issue. So it performed ok until I kept getting blue screen then it restart so by Dec. it crashed. Screen was blue then black and it stayed that way five minutes. Then it turn blue. Geeksquad of Best Buy was many time remote fixing my issues and just recently bench tested it. I need a hard drive so having heard such good reviews of this computer it a piece of crap as the Sony I bought has operated from 6/13 until 9/16 24/7. What a loss for me and I would not have known I bought junk so I'm using a HP tablet with touch screen has operated better bought same time Best Buy. Lenovo A8 is a nightmare should be recalled like a car to fix by maker."
I called with a similar issue as most of the people here. My computer was freezing and giving me the blue screen of death. I called the support and was told I needed to pay $200 for the firmware that provided a fresh reinstall to my computer to bring it back to factory. DON'T PAY THEM AND DON'T THROW AWAY your computer!!! This is a simple scare tactic to get you to pay them more money. There is a utility on every Lenovo called one key. There is literally a button on your computer (usually located above the keyboard) that you can press during boot up that will give you the option to bring your computer to factory. Tell your friends.
Purchased a Lenovo 700-22ISH from Staples and it began to make funny noises and freeze after 3 months. Called support and they told me they would order parts and was told a tech would come to my house and fix it. The parts would be sent in 3 business days. Wow! Sounded great. When no one called I contacted them again and was told the part was back ordered and would be shipped in one month. We are talking about a fan here. This is unacceptable.
"I sent my Lenovo laptop back for repair as the cd drawer had stuck a couple of times, resulting in me having to use a paperclip to release it (following advice). I use the cd writer a lot, and guessed that the mechanism had worn due to use, although I had the laptop less than a year. Lenovo had my laptop for other a month. Apparently it had to be sent to Germany. When I took the laptop back to the shop that I had purchased it from- John Lewis, I also mentioned that the screen was prone to suddenly magnifying, but could live with that. My guarantee for repairs was for two years."
"I ordered a usb recovery key from Lenovo, paid £36. When it arrived I ran it. It got 30% the way through the recovery and then crashed with a failure message. After that it was no longer possible to boot from the key. The key just didn't work. So I rang Lenovo tech support and they agreed to send me a new key. Same thing happened - this time it got 60% through the recovery and then crashed again and after that the key would no longer work. Spoke to Lenovo tech support again and sent them all the info they wanted but they never got back as they had promised. So then I wrote asking for a refund - they sent gear that didn't work and failed to sort the matter out. Guess what? They never replied. No really... What a horrendously dreadful company."
"I paid 1500 bucks for a product that broke down after one year of use. If you touch it or move it, the screen will freeze and you will have to reboot it. It's slow and freezes multiple times everyday. I can't believe I threw away this much money on this trash. (I have the yoga 3 pro.) Do yourself a favor and buy a macbook or something."
"Lenovo Yoga 7000 is the worst computer ever, It has never worked correctly. This computer constantly just shuts down; it will have clear circles that appear on the screen and will lose connection almost immediately. I have to reboot, roughly every 20-30 mins. Fun fact is I use this product for work in order to make a living. They have no customer service and no online help. Worst product ever!!! I'm not certain if it will help, however I am going to contact the BBB... Scam of a company. Even Best Buy said it was a junk product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
"Absolutely worst customer service I've ever experienced. Bought ThinkPad in Feb 2016 & was doing fine. Then failed to boot. Called Support, they walked me through couple steps, then told me I still over 2 years warranty on the product so they would schedule an on-site repair. Great. Then they called back & told me that my particular laptop was manufactured in India & they couldn't repair it because they don't have parts for ones manufactured in India. WHAT??? I thought they were kidding at first, asked for supervisor but was told the same thing. I will never, ever buy another Lenovo."
The customer service is Horrible. Took me over a month to get through. The product hard drive and battery went just over a year. They didn't care and nowhere to write a review. I will be letting Microsoft know I will not buy a Lenovo product ever again.
I have had my Yoga 2 Pro in for the exact same warranty repair 3 times. Each time they send it back and I have the same problem. When I started having issues the computer was under warranty. The warranty has since ran out and they are telling me there is nothing they can do about it even though they admit it seems like the same problem I have always had. About a month ago they offered me 10% off a new computer which I appreciate however I didn't feel was a fair offer. As a business owner I understand product issues however the ridiculous customer service process you have to go through with Lenovo is over the top.
When using Outlook it constantly just closes. I often have to write the same email three or four times. When using Excel it constantly shuts the app done. Replacement does the same with the addition of the cursor jumping up several lines of text. Worst piece of junk ever. Sending it back for an HP or Dell.
"I'm not going into huge detail but basically I purchased a new desktop. Within 30 days power supply and motherboard burnt up. I send it to Geek Squad who overnights it to the service center. Thumbs up to them, it was diagnosed within 2 days. Now it takes Lenovo over 30 days to send parts. I've still not got it back and I'm looking at another 2 weeks. It looks like the repair is going to take around 50 days. You would think they would rush the parts a little to keep a future customer. I'm done with Lenovo products. I'm selling it soon as it gets repaired. I'll take the loss, and it will be my last."
"I ordered a Lenovo laptop (ThinkPad Yoga X1) for my family as a Christmas present on December 11, 2016. I regularly purchase Lenovo products for my business and this new machine was replacing my wife's old Lenovo at home. The computer arrived a couple of days ahead of December 25, 2016 so timing was as promised."
"It just keeps working and working, and was a bargain when I bought it, and still is extremely fast. Buy a like new used Lenovo T60s laptop is plenty fast. IBM ThinkPad on eBay for less than $100. Had mine for 10 yrs."
"Bought a Yoga laptop, big mistake!!! It has never worked properly. Sent back to Lenovo twice to be fixed, waited 4 months for a part replacement, spent days and hours trying to speak to a person at customer support, sent to local repair centers 5 times, still broken and now out of warranty. ** product."
This is the worst customer service I ever encountered in my lifetime. After waiting for 45 minutes the agent did not even speak the language I chose. She was rude by proposing to me to cancel the order. Have been waiting for over 6 weeks for an order and she said to me maybe by end of month with no guarantee.
"I purchased a Lenovo Thinkpad Laptop in October 2016. After receiving the laptop, I separately purchased Microsoft Home and Business from OfficeMedia. I was unable to load it because Lenovo had preloaded software preventing it. I finally returned the OfficeMedia software, purchased the same from Lenovo for $60 more than OfficeMedia. After several weeks, customer service told me Lenovo had oversold the software, would send it to me, but could not provide a target date."
"I had my Lenovo ""ThinkCentre"" Tower PC custom built so components would be high end and completely compatible. Lenovo once supplied the hardware for IBM, eventually breaking off to create their own hardware brand. The tower has worked beautifully for two years. Very adaptable architecture allowing space and accommodating newer technologies like solid state drives and adapters."
"I totally love my Lenovo desktop. I really love this PC. It is fast, reliable, user-friendly, and was reasonably equipped and priced. I have never had any problems with it. If Lenovo keeps this up, I will likely be a customer for like... or at least until they stop making big desktops. My wife has a new desktop by another manufacturer and has nothing but problems."
"Lenovo 80jt. Got as Christmas present, used it on 28th and 29th December, shut down laptop on 30th around 3am. At 8.30am, restarted laptop and screen is damaged, took it back to shop where it was bought and contacted Lenovo support and both have said that I have physically damaged it. Where do I stand when I know I have done nothing wrong. :("
"It's a great machine, but a few things hold it back from perfection. My Lenovo Y500 is a great laptop, though it's components like the headphone jack and onboard microphone are garbage. If those components could be improved it'd be a perfect machine."
"Laptop has one design flaw, but is made well. Self diagnostic software has a mind of its own without user options. The placement of the power/sleep button on the front/left side corner is horrible. I frequently press it by accident when moving or lifting the laptop. The case is well constructed and durable. The self-diagnostic software is horrible in that it is not user configurable. It starts on its own, and pretty much hogs the processor & drive so that doing anything else is not feasible."
This win 10 desktop computer has had numerous operating system problems which Lenovo customer support was unable to solve. Lenovo has a good selection of systems. Customer support has been hit good or miss useless. Lenovo was IBM before it was bought by the Chinese. Overall it is good system for the money. Two out of three times Customer Support was from useless to clueless. Once I did get US Customer Support and they were helpful. My new desktop still takes 10 minutes to boot and has ongoing issues which customer support can't figure out. Lenovo does offer on site warranty repair if the computer mechanically breaks.
"I bought a brand new Lenovo desktop with two dongles. When one of the dongles was with open box failure, they sent me a wrong replacement. I tried to contact Lenovo and was pushed around from Lenovo, Canada to Lenovo, US, and to Lenovo Sales. Why asks customer to make so many phone calls? Can anyone in Service Department take responsibility? It seems that nobody at Lenovo wants to be responsive. I already made 5 phone calls, the issue is not resolved."
"I purchased a laptop G50 for my daughter. The new laptop failed to have a functioning keyboard. I sent the laptop in for warranty repair. Issue number one; I was required to pay to ship a brand new inoperable laptop back to the manufacturer to have it function as it should have upon delivery. It gets worse; when I received my (repaired) laptop, the package contained a notice of repaired parts. Satisfied customer I should be, right? When I go to use my newly repaired laptop, I learned that it still has the EXACT same problem that it was originally shipped with (inop keyboard). After contacting customer service, I was instructed to ship (at my cost) the laptop back to their facility and THIS TIME, it will be repaired AND tested before returning to me. WOW... never, never again!!!"
"Ordered this computer on October 26. Said shipping time was approx 4-5 weeks which in itself is unacceptable today. Still went ahead as it looked very cool with the OLED display. Shipping date was estimated at November 10. Been eagerly waiting and tracking the shipment almost daily. Then today, a day after it was supposed to ship, they notify me OLEDs are in back order. Need to wait until January. Got to be kidding. This is precisely how big companies fail. Will never order Lenovo again. Shameful!"
"Hands down the worst customer service and product I have EVER had and experienced. I will NEVER purchase another product of theirs. They don't seem to care that their products don't work, nor do they care to help resolve any issue. I have be given the run around over and over again, over a return label!!"
"I tried their web support to find out anything. It was horrible and never did get anywhere, round and round. I just got off the phone trying to find out repair status (under warranty). I have a list of 4 numbers that I have called. 1 hour and 45 minutes later was told to call back on the 15th of November. I now see the complaints of this company and wish I would have read them sooner. Very Insufficient service for a computer company. No communication or information about service repairs."
"Currently I am waiting to resolve a hardware error with my Lenovo Yoga 3. This machine was never dropped and spotless when it started freezing about a year and a half after I got it. The issue is that it was purchased to start my real estate business and due to the nature of real estate was hardly used! I read about the problem which seems to be a defect with the components they use. Apparently many users with this machine have the same issue much sooner than I did. Lenovo won't admit it’s a problem. They barely respond to your emails. The ""manager"" of service is uninterested and used to stringing people along and will only give canned responses. (Jason **)"
"Customer service stinks. I bought a laptop that malfunctioned and took it to get repaired. They kept it for months and then tried to replace it with a cheaper one when they couldn't repair it. When I finally got the correct one it also had problems and I have had a repairman here a few times. I finally got fed up and asked for a refund at the end of August. I was referred to Crystal as my case manager. She sent an email asking for my receipt which I sent immediately. I never heard anything back. After numerous emails asking what is happening, with no response, I called again to see what was happening, only to find out my case was closed. They said they would reopen the case. Again I got an email from CRYSTAL asking for my receipt, which again I have sent numerous times. I don't know if she is getting the emails or if she is just ignoring me. I am about ready to call for the 3rd time. Wish me luck."
"Moment I got this laptop it just broke and I had to get a brand new one because it couldn't be replaced. Then after getting my new one the clicker doesn't work, so I've had to buy a mouse to use it. Then a few weeks later it had to get restored with a new system for some reason. Had nothing but issues with this crappy brand, when I had a samsung it had nothing wrong with it. Even now my webcam doesn't work, and it's laggy as hell."
Lenovo Yoga 900-13ISK2 Signature Edition - It appears that Lenovo is such a large company that none of the departments interact with each other and quality control and support has disappeared. My laptop same day it was purchased the screen cracked while trying to open the lid as it's that flimsy. It took four weeks to get the laptop back as Lenovo insisted they do the repairs only as Geek Squad is not qualified per Lenovo even though they have some sort of agreement. Two weeks after getting the laptop back the SSD went out and Lenovo wanted to take the laptop for another four weeks to repair. I insisted the laptop be replaced and Best Buy did replace the Lenovo (junk). After waiting another three weeks the new Lenovo arrived. Here it is five weeks later and when the Lenovo synced to my two other machines all three machines crashed.
"I'll never order a Lenovo again. After having my Yoga 15 for 6 months, the plastic key top for Page Down fell off. No big deal, I can work without it. After having the laptop for a year, my hinge broke connecting the screen and keyboard - new screen is being ordered. The hinge is plastic and I didn't even drop it."
I do not know where to contact for the manufacturing defect of Lenovo Yogapad hinge broken. This machine I used very rarely as we have three laptops at home with another Home PC. My advice not to buy Lenovo product because of terrible customer support and not a trusted brand anymore.
"It appears that Lenovo is such a large company that none of the departments interact with each other. My laptop was fixed, (cracked screen) my fault, after six weeks of trying to find its location. In the beginning, I contacted customer support and was sent a box to return the laptop back to tech support. It fell into a ""black hole"". After multiple calls it was located and sent to tech support where it sat because nobody read the instructions that clearly stated ""repair the cracked screen"". I called and when I got to tech support they found it sitting and didn't know what to do. I just assumed the instructions got lost. I authorized the repair for $422.74. I got the laptop back after two months then found they charged my card for $1,164.74. After another month of phone calls, still waiting for my refund."
"My 80 year old father is blessed enough to be interested in and able to use a computer for email and web searches. When his last computer crashed, I went with him to purchase a new computer tower, and we ended up with a Lenovo from Best Buy. After a few months, he began getting fan errors. He contacted Lenovo three months ago, since the machine was still under warranty. He is STILL WAITING for the repair. He keeps hearing that the part has been ordered but hasn't been received, or the part is in and they just need to wait for someone to install it, etc. Three months of waiting and without his computer! He probably won't remember how to use it if and when it finally gets repaired. I am so disgusted with Lenovo and how they treat customers. It is disgraceful."
"I bought a Yoga 900 in August, a laptop that costs almost $1000. Three weeks into using the product it stopped working. I tried contacting Lenovo to get my laptop repaired, but it took them two weeks to actually send me the box required to send the laptop back to the Lenovo center. After I finally sent it back, heard no word from them for almost two months. I called to check in to see what's going on. Apparently, they were waiting for a ""media"" replacement. They said they would send a follow-up email. Never received one."
"I purchased this product for personal and light business usage and just a few days after using it the screen began to just ""go black"". I've been off and on the phone with Lenovo representatives and finally was directed to ship the machine to their repair service. This was on September 15th of this year. Since shipping it off I've heard absolutely nothing, although I've contacted them for follow up. Today, I learned the reason for the delay is due to their repair service NOT HAVING PARTS. The parts aren't due in until October 26th... A bit of information the customer service representative was happy about... However she couldn't tell me when I'd be expecting the machine back! Amazing!"
"I run 2 companies. I bought a laptop from Lenovo. Right after, I had to go out of the state for a month. I returned back to find out the computer would not connect to WIFI. After contacting the tech team, they said it could not be fixed. They told me to mail it back and they would fix it. It was over 30 days, so I could not return it to Best Buy where I had bought it. I mailed it back and a week later, they mailed it back saying it was fixed. Started it up and it was exactly the same. Not fixed. After another 2 months of complaining and being told that my case has been escalated to the very highest level, I was told on 4 separate occasions that they would send someone out to my house within 3 business days. Never a call or email."
"We bought a Lenovo laptop for our daughter for college last year and it would not work properly right away, so we returned it and got another one. That one had the same exact problems with the touchscreen and also developed key stroke problems too. We sent the laptop in for repair and after over a month (when they said it would be repaired in no more than 7 days) they said they could not fix it."
"I have been using a Lenovo G40 laptop since last year and it helped me a lot given that I am a student having numerous papers and projects with deadlines to meet. In terms of its speed, I really have no problem with it. (By the way, I am using Windows 7 for I have heard from my friends that when they've started updating their laptops with newer versions, it started to lag.) Maybe I have had experienced lags before but it was due to particular viruses I take responsibility of but I got rid of it by installing antivirus software. My only problem with this unit is that whenever I turn it on and I leave it there without using it for even a few minutes, it turns off by itself and at first, I thought that it is just its light turning off (like most of the gadgets when not in use) but whenever I need to use it already, that's the time where a blue (background) screen with a statement like, ""the laptop has encountered a problem, etc. and it needs to be turned off."""
Absolutely the WORST customer experience I have ever received. My daughter bought a Lenovo computer for college and as soon as she started using it she noticed the battery would not hold a charge. We spoke to a customer service rep in the Philippines who could not get her address correct (had 2 on the label) so a new battery was sent to the wrong address. I had to physically drive it to her - 200 miles round trip. She took it to her local tech shop at her university and they said it would cost more to replace the battery than to just buy a brand new computer!!! I called customer service back; got someone in the Philippines who stated a customer service rep would work with me to not interrupt the ability to use her computer.
Bought Lenovo 300 Ideacentre pc. I got black 0135 fan error page. Cannot get out of it. Lenovo says I have a warranty but must take to a tech to save files and pay them. The only file I have loaded is McAfee Antivirus. All I want is what I bought. A working computer not hassles! Fix or replace. I will buy more antivirus. This was sent on a 11 year old HP. The Lenovo I only just made payment #2. THANKS.
"Submitted following rating to Lenovo site, but was rejected. Seems they only accept ratings in favor for them. Bought it about 6 weeks ago. But it is already in repair for a week. The Space bar on the keyboard worked for the 1st week and then start to have no response when pressing it. Very frustrated for having this kind of problem with a brand new computer. Seem Lenovo has no QA at all."
"Upon purchasing a Lenovo Think Pad 50 directly from the company I began to experience software related issues. I call Lenovo of October 1, 2016 and was directed to purchase their ""Premium"" Support Service for an annual cost of $199.00. I spend the better part of October 1st, 2nd, 3rd on the phone with five different techs who would fix one problem and create two more. After approximately 6 hrs on the phone on the third day with all my personal email folder wiped out from Office 2016 I asked the tech to disconnect and I would contact a local service company to handle the problem."
"I purchased a Lenovo IdeaCentre 300s-11 4GB Windows 10 Desktop Computer for my kids to use for school in May 2016 and it completely stopped working within a month. I have been on the phone with customer support non-stop since then and have been told it will be fixed, a repair person will be sent, it's been expedited, a manager will call, etc. Yet I am still sitting here with a computer that will not even turn on. It would be great to have someone actually touch base with me and handle this situation. But instead I'm just told that they will call. How is it possible that in today's world I have paid for their product yet have nothing but a block of metal and plastic sitting on my table that doesn't work and they don't have to do anything or give me my money back?"
"My laptop has been decent for the most part. My complaints are others word of mouth in the way Lenovo has treated them and my own experience and fear of getting it fixed. I had a key jam within months of use and my laptop has a very hard time loading sometimes. If the screen turns off my laptop often won't allow me to turn it back on so I must do a hard reset, which isn't good for it. I don't want to send it in as I've heard horror stories about Lenovo blaming the consumer for things that are obviously not the customers fault."
"Terrible product and service. I bought a Lenovo Yoga 7100 computer. In two months it worked for less than two weeks. I had several interactions with Lenovo and they could not resolve the problem. I was told to take it to Best Buy for repair. After two weeks, the product is still waiting to be assigned to a technician. If you are buying a computer because you need it, stay away from Lenovo's products."
"I have always been a die hard Lenovo T-series laptop fan; it's all I've bought since I entered college 30+ years ago. I've had small issues with my units in the past, typically with the hard drive, but overall they've performed well (one even survived a coffee spill). Until now. In January, I bought my fourth a $1400 top of the line T450s, complete with a solid state drive, with an extended warranty. It's been a nightmare from the start. I have spent countless hours on the phone with Lenovo, dealing with repeated freezing, spontaneous rebooting, update fails, blue ""screens of death"", bios issues... You name it. Even the solid state drive crapped out and had to be swapped out (by me, and then Lenovo repeatedly ""forgot"" to send me the imaging software, delaying me a full week). I should have demanded a replacement device from the start, but we always seemed to find a way to get it going again -- and, again, I BELIEVED in Lenovo."
So I am using Lenovo ideapad 500 laptop. Whenever any mobile near to my laptop rings the screen of my laptop goes off. As per Lenovo they says that this is not a laptop problem then my question is - Why same problem is not occurring with any other laptop in my office? Why my laptop screen goes off when any mobile rings placed near my laptop? Then Lenovo people say visit service center whereas I have 3 years onsite warranty.
"I was so excited to finally buy my first ""power user"" laptop for grad school. I sprang for all the upgrades - extra RAM, fastest processor, 3k screen, SSD, even a nice video card. At just over $2000, I spent all my savings from college jobs, confident that it would be worth it. Yet, when the system shipped, several components didn't work. The fingerprint reader and video card were installed incorrectly. The trackpad had intermittent problems that required a restart. I needed the computer for class and did not have enough money left to get an on-site warranty, so I couldn't send it in to the depot, and just had to deal with it. Within the first month, the screen began to bow due to the cheap plastic casing."
"I purchased Lenovo Flex 3 in good faith at Best Buy assuming it was a ""normal"" laptop. It came with Windows 10 and a bunch of other stuff such as Xbox which cannot be uninstalled. Here is the problem. This laptop has only 27.8 GB of storage making it impossible for even Windows to update. An average disc space is about 500 GB. I keep receiving pop ups to update but with only 7 GB of free storage nothing can be downloaded."
I bought Lenovo Y50-70 in 2014 December with a warranty upgrade. Recently I sent the laptop to a service center to replace the screen (bright spots) and slightly damaged USB port. Lenovo rejected both warranty claims with the reason CID (Customer Induced Damage). I scheduled a call on the official website and nobody called me on the indicated time. I sent them messages on Facebook and was promised someone else will contact me soon. But nobody called me.
"I bought a Yoga 3 15 months ago. I lose money when I can't do my job, so for insurance, I purchased a 3-year extended warranty, with 3-day on-site support. What a joke! I hated the Yoga from the beginning (that's another story), but now it has died 3 times in the last 4 months, and Lenovo has decided to stonewall me. I have had a case open for 18 days as I write this. It was escalated 15 days ago to Customer Relations because I requested a full machine replacement after the 3rd failure, and since then CR has not contacted me, not answered my emails, not answered my direct phone calls, and not called me back - AND, Customer Service (which I call everyday) says their hands are tied since the case has been escalated to the highest level possible."
"I purchased my original Lenovo Dec 2014 (Yoga 2). I had it only for a couple of months and was having a problem. Brought it back to Best Buy, they replaced the computer. Hard drive/motherboard was bad. I used this computer only part time for my working with senior citizens (dementia/Alzheimer) music therapy. We moved and I used the computer only a few times in 4 months. Last time I used the computer the screen went and I could not get it to come back up. I took it to Best Buy, same problem. This computer was just over a year old. The motherboard/hard drive bad!!! This is an expensive computer to only work for this short period of time."
"I had the worst service support forever from this company. I bought a laptop which is pre-loaded with Windows 8. However, it had problems on Windows and I need the windows product key to recover it. I called Lenovo and was told that the windows still belongs to Lenovo although I bought the computer, so I have to pay full price to buy a Windows system CD. And then I was told by the service person (a lady) that I am being transferred to her supervisor, and then I got hung up after being left waiting for almost 40mins. THE WORST experience! NEVER buy Lenovo for your sake!"
"On 24th May of this year, I ordered a P50. It arrived on time 2 weeks later with a dead screen. The engineer came out 3 days later and said it needed a new motherboard which would take an unknown amount of time to arrive. I asked for a new laptop. Since then it has been a comedy of errors. Digital River is their sales arm who took 2 weeks to issue an RMA for a DOA laptop. In order to obtain a replacement laptop, I had to pay again prior to the refund."
"I purchased the above only 1 week ago, brand new. When I tried to use the 3D camera it was not working. Messaged the customer help to be given a driver to install. This install did not work, so I communicated back to ask what to do next. No communications to me for 2 days. So I communicated again, but this time asked for someone to call me, they did and they suggested a driver install. I had said I had been given a driver that did not work and confirmed with them the driver already given, however she had given me the same one. Due to the telephone number being international I could not call back. However, I had to get my whole hard drive to be exchanged for it to work. Unfortunately Lenovo have not communicated with me at all. Trying to raise a complaint is very difficult. Would I buy Lenovo again - Definitely NO!"
I bought a Lenovo tablet/PC a little over a year ago and had used it only a few times. The battery stopped charging and the unit will not turn on even when it is plugged into an electrical wall socket. The quality of the unit is very poor and would not recommend the brand to anyone.
"I had the exact same experience as Jason of Marietta, GA. I also purchased my All in One computer from Best Buy. When running a diagnostic the system said I had a hard drive problem. Three weeks later I finally got a tech here. He replaced the hard drive then started the install disks then left. When the last of 6 disks finished installing my computer said it couldn't find an operating system. What sense does it make to sent a tech to do part of the job and not see that everything is working!! (Per his work order he was to install new hard drive, start installation and leave) Seriously!!"
"Unfortunately, I had to give 1 star, this system requires you to leave at least 1 but it is truly undeserved! I purchased my initial Lenovo Yoga 2 1/2 yrs ago, I enjoyed the size of the laptop but was having many small irritating issues that I lived with. Eventually after the first year it failed completely, this began months of pure hell. I spent literally hours on the phone between customer support and tech repair, it was infuriating."
"I went to buy a tablet this morning, a Saturday. I had started to buy it few times and finally registered and put one in my cart under my name. I went to the cart and it showed two. I removed one and went on to PayPal to pay for it. It gave my total as $145 (correct for one + accessories) and I approved this amount with PayPal. Then it took me back to Lenovo to finalize the $145 purchase, which I did and then a page came up showing a $260 purchase, which I never authorized!!! It went ahead and added a second unit AFTER I authorized the purchase."
"I was a loyal customer of Lenovo, that said, I am now a disgusted ex customer. I have purchased numerous computers and laptops from Lenovo over the years, but starting a year or two ago their support turned into a joke. They try to scam you into purchasing extra support features that you think you get when you pay for a three year warranty plan. They tried to charge me $99 to fix my fingerprint scanner, they said it was a software problem, not a hardware problem; but how would they know what the situation was without troubleshooting the problem. I told them I was locked out of my laptop due to the failure of the fingerprint reader, I believe they used this to try to extort money from me. When they finally accepted that the problem was hardware, they created a case and said they would send the part and a tech. Guess what, I never heard back from them."
"If you are planning to buy a laptop DON'T BUY LENOVO. You will regret and throw away! I have a Lenovo laptop, purchased in the month of April 2016. It is just about two to three months old. The battery goes off suddenly. On 15th June 2016 I had submitted a written complaint along with the battery performance report to a customer care executive. This was after calling twice the customer care service. This person has never responded till date. So on the next day I had forwarded the same email to: Services_ED"
Let me start of by saying I don't leave reviews very often. But the technical support at Lenovo has been so poor that I'm forced to do so. Scenario: I purchased all in one Lenovo computer from Best Buy in 2015. I got an error message saying contact technical support due to some hard drive issue. I did and thankfully it was within the one year warranty period.
Purchased this item 3 years ago. Worked fine. When Windows upgraded to 8.1 and 10 touch screen stopped working. Lenovo's response to this is go back to 8 or buy another laptop. Lenovo should be able to keep pace with the technology or offer a fix so this doesn't happen. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER LENOVO PRODUCT!!!
I recently bought a Yoga 900 online from Lenovo. When I tried to add a case for laptop the system did not allow it. 2 days later I chatted with Lenovo re buying the leather sleeve. They refused to honor their online price though they had evidence I just bought their expensive laptop. Well this is poor customer service and classless behavior that will not win customers at all.
"I bought a laptop (Lenovo G50-80: model no - 80E6) which has got some hardware issues. Upon complaining to the showroom (DIGITAL DREAMS, Shop No. 5, Jayanti Market, Jaipur - 302001, Rajasthan. Phone number: 01133147045), they were not at all helpful and were very abusive to the me. They have some contact with the local goons and taking their names. They started saying that ""you have purchased a laptop not me"" and even try to fight with me. They started using abusive languages and torturing us. The whole incident is done by a lady who is so-called Manager there and do not have any courtesy. They then advise to contact the service center available in Jaipur."
"We purchased a Lenovo touch screen laptop for my niece in April of this year. She put a picture pass code on the computer and also a password if the picture password did not work. This past week she entered the picture code incorrectly too many times, and the password is also not working. After several days of trying we called Lenovo to see if they could at least help reset the root user password so that she could reset the password without erasing the whole computer. We were told that we had to pay 19.99 a month for 10 months, 199.00 for a year, or a 1 time fee of 129.00 for the incident. It is outrageous that we cannot get support to reset a password. These people are trying to rob you blind over their own product. They do not support their own software? They didn't even offer a self help site. Just ""you pay and we will transfer you again"". They should NOT be allowed to market any product they don't fully support."
"Lenovo computers - poor quality, poor customer service, cannot talk to anyone. Lenovo, once thought to be a top brand. Bought a G 500S Touch 3 years ago, and have had 3 motherboard failures (most recent verified by a Lenovo certified Technician). On the first failure, Lenovo had me by a 2 year in home warranty, thought great, got it fixed. On the 2nd failure, Lenovo informed me the warranty was 2 years from computer purchase, not 2 years from warranty purchase. Would not fix it. Watch out for Lenovo computers, 3 year old computer with 3 motherboard failures. Stay clear, poor quality, poor service, and do not stand behind their products."
Bought X1 Carbon laptop 1.5 years ago - 20a7 CTO1WW. Integrated Graphics Card died couple weeks ago. Spoke with support. Have to buy 1200$ new motherboard. Amazing low quality.
Computer good -- ordering was confusing. 29:1 card reader would not read SD card. I emailed Mike ** with whom I chatted when ordering and got no response. After a few weeks I called and in troubleshooting I noticed the edge of a circuit board blocking the slot. A service call was set up and a tech came out the next day with a new card reader. It appears that the card reader was installed incorrectly. No one told me that my DVI connection to my monitor would need an adapter which Lenovo does not sell. The sales dept recommended a vendor which sells an adapter for $49. I found it online for $14. When ordering I received incorrect information three times. I was told if I opened the case the warranty would be void. I returned the graphics card I had purchased (which had a DVI out) and ordered the Lenovo graphics card.
"Ordered 2 Lenovo ThinkPad P50's from Lenovo in Apr. Upon arrival I set the first one up. Added software, downloaded drivers, etc. Then I connected it to my external monitor. Didn't work. Called support, and after about 5 hours they would do no more, because the problem, I was told, was in the monitor or cable connection. Bought a new monitor and cable, but no luck and after another 4 hours of talking to Lenovo (and a software tech support cost of $70 more), MS and the monitor manufacturer for help, I finally bought a new Lenovo ThinkVision monitor. Unfortunately this did not work either. Sometimes it would come on but mostly not. Finally, Lenovo said it was a motherboard problem and they ordered a new one for installation."
"Y510 piece of junk - Hate this computer. Constantly says, ""pc encountered a problem and needs to shut down"" out of the blue for no reason. Then when it tries to restart, it says, ""no bootable device"" and it will not restart, so I have to shut it down and restart it. I wish I had never spent my precious, hard-earned money on it. When I first got it, it was so full of bloatware it took me weeks to get it to a usable condition. My hands keep hitting the touchpad and increasing and decreasing the page size. Hate this computer."
"I used a D30 personal computer in my previous job in systems trading. I'm thrilled to see that the computer has 16 processors that has 2 GB of memory per processor, which totals a 32 GB of RAM for the entire PC. This is great for systems trading because the development of quantitative trading systems requires high-speed and high performance processors. However, I don't like the customer service of Lenovo, because when we needed a replacement of our defective D30, they told us that it only took two weeks for us to receive the replacement, but we waited MORE THAN 3 WEEKS to receive the replacement. Nevertheless, I'm satisfied with D30, but I recommend Dell Precision T7500 over Lenovo D30 because of the higher RAM. The RAM of Dell Precision T7500 is 192GB, WAY HIGHER than the 32 GB of Lenovo D30."
"I bought a Lenovo Laptop last year and since then I am quite depressed with its malfunction. Most of the time, when I am writing a message on Facebook or working in an important paper, suddenly it stops working (jamming) and there is no way to operate on the computer, unless unplugging the battery or keep pressing the Power Button to shut it down. My friends who bought the same model of laptop (model Name: G50-30 80G0) also complain of such problem."
"Under warranty one of our companies high end laptop, had two keys fall off under normal business use. It took a week to get them to send us a return box, with a promise for a 7 working day turn around and now nearly one month into this process the simple replacement of two keys has not been fixed. Countless calls, that are routed through the Philippines, got us no closer. They said they do not have a working email, or tracking system that works. When asked to be routed to a US supervisor, they indicated that they no longer have any US repair support, even though the work is done in the US. We purchased 5 Lenovo products this past year. Poor service... how about NO SERVICE."
"I purchased a Lenovo ThinkPad T440s for my daughter when she was going away to college. I purchased it directly from Lenovo and had it custom-built to our specifications. When all was said and done, the laptop, cost of software, and a 3-year warranty totaled just under $1,400. From day one, the laptop has functioned very slowly and often freezes up. My daughter complains about it constantly. Now she was in the process of writing a final paper for her business law class, and the laptop keeps sending her through an automatic repair loop. No matter what she presses, the screen tells her the laptop is in need of repairs. She cannot access any of her files, and therefore, cannot access the final paper, which was 70% complete."
"I bought a new laptop of Lenovo G5030 on march 2016. Its serial number is: PF09MXXE, from India, hyderabad. Dealer: Shweta computer bazar. CST number: SEC/03/1/4080-00-01. At the time when I purchased this laptop they said me, ""If any problem you will get call to the help line number of Lenovo. They will come to your door and provide the service and for one year it is free of cost."""
"After spending many hours online, talking to support, mailing my laptop to them, the problem still exists and I will never be buying or recommending a Lenovo. The cursor goes crazy, opens many pages at once, will not move anything. I have tried everything. Lenovo said laptop was broken, maybe I bought it that way? Can't use it with any reliability. Very disappointed in the support. It is a G50."
I called CS to get the warranty updated to the correct date of expiration. They told me to email lenovo_pop@suth.com who would handle that for me. Of course they never responded after 2 emails and now the correct warranty date has expired. I really thought better of Lenovo but I guess I was wrong.
"I have a Lenovo V560 which I purchased secondhand back in 2009 at Craigslist US. My co-teacher's hubby helped me buy it as he was in that area at the time. I like its quality, or maybe it was made in US and it's built that way. I'm still using it as of the moment and it's been failing at times this year, though it's understandable as it's getting old. Lenovo laptops had been top of the brands ever since, but lately they're like easy to get broken. Their parts are now made in China even though the whole thing's made in US. My friend bought hers here back in 2014, and it's not functioning anymore. How I wish this company would not go down the drain as time passes, they're losing quality on their products."
"I purchased a Lenovo Edge 2 15 inch on 1/01/16. It worked okay for a few days (it had trouble from waking up from day 1 but would eventually wake up), then the internet connection kept getting disconnected, had so much trouble waking up from sleep, then finally went to the tablet mode and I couldn't move it back to the desktop mode no matter what I did, then it started making a terrible sound and finally died three months later. I contacted the Lenovo customer service on 4/18/16 and here I am on 5/18/16, one month later, the problem is still not resolved. To make the long, miserable story short, Lenovo's customer service is one of the worst I have ever encountered, made me waste so much of my time, energy and I feel I got horrible scammed and ripped off."
"Stick to making laptops, Lenovo. Leave the smartphone market to more capable companies. Had a chance to use a Lenovo smartphone and after a few weeks, it took everything out of me not to throw it out the window. I wouldn't even torture myself with using it as a doorstop. That's how bad it is. We gave it away as soon as I saved enough money to buy another smartphone (a Windows phone, because I'm never using another Android again). And from what I've read, Lenovo's laptops aren't so great, either. I suppose the Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Never ever buy anything from Lenovo. There are plenty of Android smartphones out there, leave this out of consideration. Save yourself the stress and the headaches."
"Purchased my $1000 laptop November 2014. Problems 6 months later. One by one, the Windows started shutting down. Only had access to the internet. I was scared of this thing when the OS died off one piece at a time. Over a 5 month time frame, I called their warranty & customer service department at least 2 dozen times. Found out, they are in the Philippines. Spent way too many hours on hold, spoke to far too many reps & supervisors & if you deviate from their menu script... they get lost. I NEED SOMEONE FLUENT IN ENGLISH! They had me reboot, restore & constantly repeat the problem every time I called with a service # that they gave me... which changed every time as a new service ticket would be issued. They told me to contact Microsoft for help. Microsoft sent me back to Lenovo. I'm the ball in a friggin tennis match now! More calls, more hold, more service tickets."
"The tech support people at Lenovo are real pros. So far I have found them to be very knowledgeable, available and helpful. I would have rated the features even higher except for the number and type of ports. Some of this was overcome by utilizing a docking station which had quite a few (albeit difficult to differentiate in terms of high-speed v. standard) ports. I currently have four (4) 27"" monitors connected to the laptop and dock, but had to connect my most recent 40"" monitor to the computer itself because the dock doesn't have a mini display port."
"While you can eventually get someone on the phone, they can't do much to help. The only thing customer support could do was reset to factory spec & when that didn't work, tell me to send the laptop to them where the repair would start at over $200. Really?! And the repair cost could go up to $400. Awful. My laptop is 2 yrs old. They should've sent me a replacement for the junk they put out. It's wonderfully slim, has great eye-appeal. The Bluetooth is very responsive. I had trouble with WiFi after the Windows 10 upgrade, but CUSTOMER SERVICE did their great 1-dimensional bios reset and fixed that, so that's great again. Very quick. LOVE the backlit keyboard. Now if only it worked... Considering my favorite feature, the backlit keyboard, is no longer working, the laptop was vastly overpriced. I bought it from a home shopping network because I needed a payment plan."
"After two weeks that I purchased the Lenovo PC all-in-one, my computer was attacked by variety of corrupted files and viruses. Even the Office Depot sold me the antivirus, I did not receive a fraction of warning. After two weeks using this junk, I had to pay $200 to Lenovo customer support to fix my computer."
"Lenovo G500s - Initially I had trouble with Wi-Fi, but my biggest issue was with the battery life and charger cord cracking. When calling Lenovo they were of no help. As a matter a fact, they told me they did not have one single complaint. When I laughed and said I find this impossible she was rude, crude and could care less about my issues."
"I bought an all in one because they recommended it to me at Best Buy but they did not have it at the store so they instructed me to buy it online. It was my biggest mistake. Expensive computer but worthless. Have called Lenovo to no avail. I bought a three year warranty. Lenovo states that there is nothing wrong with the computer even though it cannot accept any updates. No updates, extremely slow - takes 10 min. to start - most of the time I am unable to stream, unable to add programs. It works for internet only (at times) and office. A 1,500.00 computer works like an 100 Dell computer but Lenovo and Best Buy are only washing their hands. On top of that I paid 350.00 for a 3 year warranty with Best Buy and is also worthless. Thanks to Lenovo I'm stuck with this worthless computer and unable to buy another one because I cannot currently afford one."
"The following describes incompetent Lenovo technical support and customer service. My 2014 ThinkPad XI Carbon laptop crashed after I downloaded Lenovo updates. I called Lenovo support when the monitor screen remained black but the power light and keyboard lights continued to blink on and off. I couldn't turn off the power. The first Lenovo rep didn't know how to turn off the power, and kept recommending that I buy an extended warranty. After hanging up, I read print information describing the reset the rep denied existed, inserted a sewing needle to reset the laptop, and the power finally turned off."
I bought a Lenovo E440 thinkpad a little over a year ago. I decided to upgrade my laptop to windows 10. After upgrading I then had realized my computer was experiencing issues. I contacted Microsoft about their issues. Not to my surprise I found out they were unable to assist me in reinstall windows 7pro. I had let more than thirty days pass assuming that windows would patch everything up. I was informed that my computer was not compatible with Windows 10 and that it was the company's responsibility to update the driver's so that the operating systems can work properly.
"I purchased 2 Lenovo Idea pad 100S from Best Buy for my children that needed internet access for classes in school. My daughter's laptop functioned off and on, kept giving me an error that it couldn't find internet connections, even when in public wifi areas. The voice narrator kept coming on even after being turned off many times. The passcode kept changing back to my gmail account, and the computer could never find wifi."
"My brand new Lenovo H50-50 desktop exhibits a bit of a glitch. When the power is turned on, the computer may or may not immediately start. Sometimes it just hangs there with Lenovo showing on the screen; sometimes it may then just turn dark. So far I have lucky (I am writing this on the H50-50) but I keep the computer on all the time and hope that it reboots after any automatic updates."
"I've regretted the purchase of this Lenovo G50 from the start. Constantly freezes up, the mouseless touch pad locks up for no reason then unlocks after an hr, a day, a week... who knows. Anytime you let the computer sleep or hibernate or log off or just let it idle for ten minutes it loses connectivity. Then it takes 5 minutes to find the server again ""EVERY TIME"". Battery life is two hrs!! That's it. This thing is total crap."
"After less than 3 months, I received a warning of pending hard disc failure on my new Lenovo K450E desktop computer. I had purchased the extended in-home warranty, so attempted to contact Lenovo online. Their online customer service site was not working properly. After initial entries, it took me to a second page which subsequently sent me back to the first page. An attempted phone call promised a wait of at least 45 minutes, so I scheduled a call-back for 10:30 that evening. No call-back came at 10:30. I scheduled an additional call-back, for the following morning, which did come. The representative barely spoke English and was difficult to understand. She promised a technician would call within 24 hours to schedule an in-home visit to replace the hard disc."
I purchased two Yoga 2 laptops in the past year and am highly unsatisfied with both. One has been returned under Best Buy warranty however Lenovo refuses to respond satisfactorily to my requests for refund of second computer which is defective. The Yoga 2 is incompatible with Windows 10 when upgraded from 8. I had this problem with both computers so they are defective when trying to use the latest software. The second computer has been into the Geek Squad/Best Buy repair shop SIX times and they are unable to determine why it drops the internet. Clearly the computer is defective and I need a refund however they continue to stall to run out the warranty.
"After receiving a g50 touch for Christmas, I had my system shut down with a critical process died error message 3 times within a month. The system is horribly slow - worse than my laptop that is over 8 years old. I call Lenovo for support on January 30th. First I can't hear or understand the service people. They don't speak English well and sound like they are in a tin can. Then I finally get transferred to a software support person who says they can only help me for a fee. Seriously, this machine is a month old and you won't provide customer support. Even if it's a windows 10 issue, Lenovo should support their customers. Awful! I will never buy another Lenovo again!"
"It stopped working after only two weeks. Lenovo Service Center; first time they replaced the motherboard, and second time they just reinstalled Windows 8. According to Lenovo’s support center, the original problem was a problem with the hinges that is common for this model. This product was new, and it was clear just weeks after purchase that the product was defective. It should have been replaced, not repaired. The laptop still does not work as it should. The following issues remain:"
"The reason my laptop stopped working was because of the charger port on my laptop. I accidentally put the charger the wrong way in, and it pushed the yellow piece back. I even fixed it once with a paperclip and it charged. Eventually with no charger port, the laptop remained dead. I called Lenovo, set up appointments. A customer service rep said that I could go to Best Buy and see if they could repair it. SO, I drove 40 minutes out, twice! Lenovo failed to explain that Best Buy does not carry the Yoga Pro 3. I was extremely aggravated already. So, in desperation, I sent my laptop to Texas which was a couple hundred dollars initially."
"So my computer is a Lenovo H520s with 8 gb of RAM and 2tb Seagate Barracuda hard drive. Recently after patching Windows 10, 3 days later I received a random unmountable_boot_volume error. After this error appears, Windows attempts an automatic repair and then says diagnosing your PC. It gets stuck in this infinite loop and the computer keeps restarting."
"I bought it on Lenovo website, was advertised with Win10, but had to upgrade. After upgrade PC is running very slow, i7 performing slower than i3. Will not let any of my 3 scanners scan, (medical records business), all crash. Not usable in my business. Canon pointed finger at Microsoft, Microsoft at Lenovo. Lenovo promised to fix with remote connect for a FEE! Did not, will NOT refund. Trying to return PC back to Lenovo, but because of all the time had gone by waiting, now I'm outside of the 30-day return policy. I feel scammed, by Lenovo. Customer service is unhelpful and are trained well not to accept returns. STAY AWAY. Dr. K."
"It has contrasted itself with a prior (10"") s10 in xp which kicks it's **... This thing right out of the box interrupted so many easy processes with proprietary junkware I could not believe it. SLOW len oh no! It's not bloatware at all - it's their really dumb flunky unnecessary obstacles that are just damn slow... The ""solution center"" is absolutely mentally ill in it's presentation and it's invasive aspects are incredibly worthless. This lame touch pad I'm using is also non responsive crap, it feels like it was designed for the less fortunate literally persons all thumbs and devoid of intellect."
I have bought Lenovo laptop y50-70 touch. The laptop cost is $1000. However there is a manufacturing issue that many people are facing with the hinge: **. After struggling with Lenovo service center in Malaysia for I was able to get the approval to fix it. According to the article I don't even need to get an approval. They are admitting that it's a manufacturing issue and they are saying they are willing to fix it without any problem.
"I recently bought a Lenovo E550 and I want to share my huge disappointment with the device. They charge it with a decent price - I paid 850+ GBP for it, and for that amount of money I expect some quality stuff. But what I got is basically piece of garbage. First off, the overall quality of the material is very bad. You can feel the cheap plastic under your fingers when you take it in your hands, you can actually even hear it. Talk about 'tank strong' Lenovo laptops that they brag about. **."
"I purchased the new Lenovo in order to do a job search at home. It was the worst experience ever. I went back to Best Buy after 16 days and they would not take it back. It shut down all the time, was unable to get any assistance from customer support and on and on!!! After going to the Better Business Bureau and providing them screenshots of problems and emails to Lenovo, which even included a case number they set up but never honored, they lied to the Better Business Bureau. I refuse to ever buy anything from them ever again. Worst customer service ever and do not even honor their warranty. I would suppose the Attorney General would love to be contacted."
"I bought a Lenovo Series H50 computer recently and immediately after booting up, started having an issue of getting a declining 3 tone sound followed by a black screen that reduced my images to about 50%. Seconds later, the same declining 3 tone sound and another black screen followed by my images returning to normal. This issue keeps on going randomly. I sent an email to the Lenovo website about 10 days ago and still have no response. Anyone experiencing the same issue? Any suggestions how it can be corrected?"
"Garbage! Don't waste a dime on this junk! Changes screens all the time on its own. Size of screen changes on its own. Wouldn't have another one of these if it was free!!! Terrible, bad, bad, bad."
"So I bought my laptop February of 2014 and I loved it. Never had a problem until my son spilled apple juice on it. Open and shut case? No. The laptop shut down and because I never bought the accident warranty I went to a certified technician willing to pay whatever for my dying friend. He opens my friend and guess what? Apparently, inside my laptop was signs of tampering, things that caused my laptop to shut down. The APPLE JUICE NEVER MADE IT PAST THE KEYBOARD. Someone, before I got my NEW laptop, was inside of it. Scorch marks, tampering with the mother board, all types of **. I hope Lenovo goes out of business. I sent my laptop to them one week ago and these ** are telling me that THEY CAN'T FIND IT! I'm so upset, I paid $600 for this ** laptop for these ** to tell me that they can't find my **."
"As I write this review I have discovered that Lenovo false advertises what they sell, does not honor their contractual agreements, and (in my opinion) is untruthful to its customers. I have been on hold with two different supervisors (the last supervisor I spoke to was Tony) with still no result. Please note that no matter who you deal with I strongly urge you to write down names, dates, and times that the conversations occur, as the next person you talk to will most likely tell you something different than the original person or tell you they do not know what was discussed. My whole ordeal started when the laptop that was purchased developed a purple haze on the screen. After going through the initial over the phone troubleshooting, it was deemed that a service call would be needed to repair the laptop. I was happy to hear this since I renewed the warranty and chose the 1 year, in home post warranty, NEXT BUSINESS DAY option."
"I purchased a Yoga 2 Pro in Feb 2015 and also purchased a one year in home tech warranty. I've had two issues that I cannot get resolved despite repeated calls and promises to take action. First, the material on my keyboard is rubbing off so severely that you can no longer see the letters on the keys. This began about six months after purchase. In November I contacted Lenovo Support and was asked to send pictures, which I did. I received an email the following week stating the part needed was on back order and would arrive by Dec 10, after which someone would call me to schedule the repair. I didn't hear anything so I sent follow up emails on Dec 15 and Dec 18 and received no response. On January 4, I called again and was told someone had contacted me and was told there was no issue. This is not true. Either someone is being dishonest or someone called the wrong number because the number is my cell and no one but me answers this phone."
"OK so I know there is nothing wrong per se with my computer, and I can do a bunch of research on it. A new computer about 2 months old and we are having trouble getting it out of sleep mode without hard rebooting it. The technician said they could not tell me how to set the display settings (which he ""recommends"" as the initial approach) without selling me a full on premium service agreement. Thanks Lenovo. Hardware supported, but not your install with known issues."
"Well...first of all I am a kind of guy who has never given a negative review in my entire life, but today this is going to change all of that. Well anyways I have purchased Lenovo y40 laptop on Jan 2015 for $799. Well honestly the laptop was awesome but the only defect it had was the cheap plastic that is there at the shaft that connects the screen to the keyboard as well as that on the border on the screen because of the usage the plastic at the shaft opened up because of poor design. When I called up Lenovo I was told they would fix it as I had warranty. After additional spending of $20 for shipping it to Lenovo help center, I was told that I had to pay $260 for repairing that cheap plastic."
"I am one of your customers who had been satisfied with my first purchase of a Lenovo laptop so I purchased another Lenovo system recently. I am hoping that you may be able to help me resolve a challenge I am facing. I purchased my Lenovo Yoga Series 3-1470 on August 23, 2015 and after many weeks of frustration because the USB ports were not working properly, I sent the laptop back to Lenovo Service Center on October 26th. On October 29th, I received an email from the Lenovo Warranty Support and Service Team to confirm that they had determined what the failing component was, but that the part was currently unavailable. I was without my laptop for three weeks when I emailed the Service Team on November 12th to find out why I hadn't heard anything about when my laptop would be ready and if it wasn't ready would they provide me with a loaner laptop or a new laptop."
"I had called Lenovo about some performance issues on my Lenovo Y50-70, they had completed some troubleshooting and concluded that the Premium Technical Support should be able to assist me and address these performance issues. I was only told the $200 price option and had to haggle until they told me I have the option of a 1 time fee of $100. This IS NOT worth the money. I had declined the first time I called, but this time I decided that maybe it could be worth it, besides, I was told I have 3 days to decide if I am satisfied and that I can apply for a refund. WRONG. The technical support worked on the laptop for about an hour, and all they had done was used various software to scan for viruses and do cleanup, all of which I can do myself. None of this made a difference in the performance, it was still slower than my Lenovo Yoga 3 while playing the same game side by side."
"This company must be owned by the PLA. Lenovo sucks so hard it is not believable. I cannot describe the emotional pain dealing with my new turd laptop has caused me. It has so many minor defects and problems that keep popping up. I am really thinking about stabbing my hand right now. I had Toshiba prior and Toshiba is a DREAM compared to this joke of a laptop. Furthermore, their bundled software and service center and skin is like designed to pop up in all types of obnoxious times and places."
Hinges break easily and your battery is crap. For the amount of money invested it is complete utter garbage. You should be liable for adding excessive trash to landfills worldwide! Sheer utter garbage.
"I have a Lenovo Y50-70 MultiTouch UHD Display. Since day one some of the websites or some of the pop up screens or notifications, etc. appear on display, so small that you can't even read (can be seen attached). I played with the resolution settings and checked everything I can to fix it myself but no way. Finally, today I decided to call the customer support. I was on the phone for an hr, I talked to 4 different people from 4 different departments and none of them helped me. Last person I talked to was put me on hold for a while and then this survey recording came up asking me to rate the quality of the service. It was like a joke. They bounced me from one to another. Now I totally understand why people buy Mac. I want them to help resolve my issue or take this laptop and give me full refund."
"Let me start by saying that my Lenovo Y50-70 laptop is UNDER WARRANTY! Total time invested in this frustrating mess: 3 HOURS on the phone with Lenovo, and one VERY rude technician hanging up on me. Due to manufacture defect, the screws on the back of the laptop were loose. I was unaware of this until I noticed one on my desk. Upon further inspection another was missing. I tightened the 11 tiny Philips head screws I still had. I called Lenovo customer service today to get a replacement screw. Under my warranty a facade screw would logically be considered a ""Customer Replaceable Unit (CRU)"" which warrants Lenovo to send a part to the customer. Simple. Easy. Everybody is happy, right?"
"I got a Lenovo Laptop G570, and after a year the hinges and plastic pegs snap off the base. This model have this problem and Lenovo don't accept this model has a defect. LENOVO IS THE WORST COMPUTER. DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP EVER!!"
Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon - The computer would quit every time the charger was removed. Started a service request and was told that the part was on back-order. Finally told on 9/28 that the part was in. Turns out it went to the wrong address. They won't ship it to the right address so they cancelled the first service request and made a new one. Now the part is on back-order again! It is now 10/1 and we have been waiting since 9/8 for this computer to be repaired. Just to add insult to injury we actually paid the extra $400 for the advanced customer service with a 1 day turnaround guarantee. More like 1 month!
"To be fair, I am a MAC user so my expectations are high. I bought a Lenovo Erazer because I have an accounting software that works best on PC platform. This is the worst piece of equipment ever. If only there was a competent person from Lenovo to help decipher the many technical problems, maybe it would not be so painful. To make matters worse when I dial customer service and after being transferred to multiple folks, they all seem to blame Lenovo problems on me."
"Have finally given up on getting any help from Lenovo. The Windows 10 virus update totally screwed my new laptop and they offer NO help with drivers or suggestions. All they do is send you to an already overcrowded forum where everyone is totally clueless. Every now and then a ""Lenovo moderator"" will chime in with outdated and useless help. This is how Lenovo treats its customers after the sale so you better think about another brand besides China Crap Lenovo! It wouldn't be so bad if there was an actual online person with feedback but no, nothing and no one with any help. I have been trying for 6 weeks to get help with all the failed apps and hotkeys and still not one response from Lenovo. Gonna sell the Lenovo junk now and never ever buy another one. Good advice is you avoid the product line all together…"
"My battery went dead on my laptop (Lenovo Yoga 13), then it would not charge nor power up with the power adapter. I paid extra for onsite repair. The technician came out with a new battery and adapter and neither fixed the issue. Lenovo suggested for me to send it back to them. They sent out a box and I sent it to them. That was over 6 weeks ago. Part back ordered. Now it is being repaired but no update to their website and I cannot not get any response except they are working on it. I might get my laptop back by Christmas. This is my second Lenovo. Never again. Buy American."
"I ordered the Yoga tablet 3 months ago. Since then, the tablet has its fair amount of freezing and shutting down without turning back on. A couple of weeks ago, the tablet shut down, never to turn on again. I emailed Lenovo multiple times, as well as trying to get my money refunded due to it being defective, yet still under warranty. Two weeks later, I finally received an email back saying that I am unable to get my money back and should contact technical support. From what I have seen on here, this seems like classic Lenovo and I am unsure that T. Support will be any help. Now I am stuck with a dead tablet and out a couple hundred dollars."
Lenovo a6000+ - Contact is invisible in update of lollipop in WhatsApp. Facing a problem after update. Please make it perfect as soon as possible. There is also problem of hang in update. Vibrate mode is also not available in notification bar.
"This past spring I purchased a Lenovo Yoga 3. To date this has been one of the worst decisions of my adult life. Since buying this product, I have had continuous problems with it not charging and have been unable to use it about 60% of the time I've owned it. After it not holding a charge, I called support (which are tech) and the rep walked me through diagnostics process. After a couple of hours, she said she would contact me the next day to FINALLY process a pick up. She did and I sent it back."
I am writing this review as I have made it my mission to warn others from the trap of Lenovo. This company is the worst when it comes to after-sales customer service. It is virtually non-existent. I have had issues with my laptop ever since the day I got it. It's the Flex 2 and it is meant to be one of the new laptops with a touch screen which freezes the mouse when it is used. I recently have issues with my laptop connecting with the internet. I have called Lenovo 4 times now and this issue has now been going on for a week yet nothing has been done about. Rather I keep getting passed on to different people and keep getting told that they don't handle this department.
"I bought myself a brand new Lenovo H535 desktop a couple of months back. I noticed that the computer would restart itself for no apparent reason. So I call the customer service to diagnose the issue, since after looking online, I couldn't find a solution to my issues. So they tell me that I need to buy a disk to restore Windows, which they said costed around 70$. I hang up after an argument with the guy I was talking to. I find out that my power supply was malfunctioning. So I called Lenovo for a replacement part. They tell me that my warranty expires. I check my warranty online and it says that I have 11 months left on it. They continue to tell me that my warranty has expired. After over 2 1/2 months, Lenovo finally sends a technician to my house that was covered under my warranty to come replace the parts. I really hate Lenovo customer support."
"This is the second Lenovo I bought. The first one I bought through Amazon. It broke, literally, when I folded it in half. I was able to get my money back and upgraded but this time I bought it through Lenovo. Big, big mistake. I also purchased an upgraded warranty and premium support. My Lenovo Yoga Pro 2 will not turn on. I can't get anyone anywhere, via phone, chat or the premium support to help me. It has been hours and hours. I use this for work. Never ever again will I buy a Lenovo."
"Two months after purchase of an Erazer desktop the unit died (no picture, keyboard and hard drive failed to operate). Called the online technician who diagnosed it as a failed video card and said he was setting up a repair order to have it replaced in my house under warranty. Was told a follow up call would be received. After several days of not hearing anything, I called to find out that the part would not be available for a month and a half. I asked if it could be expedited and was given the name and phone number of the regional manager who would return my inquiry. No call back, no response to my email. When I called customer service was told that the management team would call back in 24 hours. It is a week later and still no contact. I do not know if the part will ever come or the machine repaired. Poor customer service leaving me in doubt of the value of the machine."
"I purchased Lenovo G50-70 in Feb. There was a screen issue and as the product is still under warranty I had raised a complaint and they sent an engineer (Wipro employee (Service One contract)) to replace the screen. While replacing the screen engineer broke the screen cover and when I informed about this on the same day, he said they will get the screen cover replaced. After a day when I called them to check the status, they say I broke the screen cover not their engineer. Then I again complained about this to Lenovo and the Wipro but till now I haven't received any proper response from them."
"These guys have had my laptop for almost a month now and I was told that once they received it, it'll be 7 days to get it fix and ship it back to me. I received an update that the part is not available, a hard drive, and it's not available??? They said that the part will not be shipped to them until Aug 21st. I just called today and now the part will not be shipped by Sept 2nd, the 7 days to fix then another shipping wait time. My daughter needs this laptop for her Senior year in college and it is very critical that she has this!!! Their service has been very poor to me and I'm sure this will not be acceptable to other customer as well. As I'm reading through other repair complaints, it's mostly the same, part not available, promised a date but not happening... total BS!!!"
"After three tech support and repair related calls and visits from tech on my computer that is less than 6 months old, purchased new from Best Buy, it still does not operate correctly. It shuts down when logging on, in most cases it shuts down while in the midst of a project or online. I do not want to call for tech support again due to the time frame and waste of time and most importantly, I use this computer for work for my business and I am losing money in the process. I want Lenovo to either give me a new computer or refund my money and award me money for the extreme inconvenience."
"Lenovo's customer service isn't just lacking: it's non-existent. I purchased a Lenovo Z51 online from an online special. Three weeks after purchase, I had heard nothing from Lenovo, yet I should have received the laptop as of two estimated shipping dates. I called the company, and I was told this laptop was no longer being made. Frustrated, I cancelled the order, and eventually placed an order for a similar computer a few days later (Lenovo Z40-70). I received an estimated shipping date for January 2016, roughly 6 months from the date of purchase. Once again, I called Lenovo, and I was told the manufacturer was waiting on parts, and the shipping date may later be revised. Once again, I cancelled my order."
"Fellow Consumers: When I happened on this site addressing the quality of Laptops, I was shocked and amazed at the sheer volume of 1-star reviews of Lenovo in reference to their quality of Service and Repair Department. While I have had some issues with my Lenovo e520 and e530, their servicing of my requests has been not only positive but has left me no choice, if I wish to be honest, than to rate this company consistently exemplary. Each and every issue of mine was greeted with courtesy and compliance, and the alacrity of the process, from my initial request for service, to the successful return of my corrected machine, was so incredibly quick that it never failed to boggle my mind."
"I purchased a Lenovo laptop (YBO4532653) on 03-09-2014 with 3 years of warranty (1 on time + 2 after registering their services). From first month I am facing the issues with that machine, following are major issues: 1. Warranty still not upgraded even after following multiple times (by writing mails, making calls on customer care). 2. They supported on 2-3 complaints and now they are not supporting on any issue. I am very helpless, please suggest me what to do."
Laptop temperature is high. Ram memory seems high but it is not. I cannot be able to run my design software. It is very slow. The power durability without electricity is short. The touchpad is not stable. It has not good performance at all. Pls give me solution.
"Lenovo claim that our device was damaged - they claim the charging connector on our device has moved from the housing and not covered under the manufacturer warranty. They then sent a pic of what is meant to be our device! That is not how we posted out our device out, so it's either a photo of someone else's device or they have damaged it on purpose! I am furious and after several e-mails they still will not send me the complaints details. I am not paying 85 for a fault with the device. The fault when posted was: The device failed to charge. We had the same problem in April, which they repairs promptly. I'm furious that Lenovo can get away with such fraud."
"1 month later, 4 technicians, 15 calls to helpdesk and still no working computer. The worst helpdesk I have ever dealt with. Warranty is a bunch of nonsense and the long wait only for them to send someone that has no CLUE. I will never purchase a Lenovo again. Oh, I forgot to say my Lenovo laptop also is not working either. I only added one star because it is required, otherwise it would be 0..."
"I purchased this computer in 2014 at Christmas, little I knew this computer ended up to be recalled many times for many parts. Two months after buying it, the computer broke. Then I was without computer for 2 months, they ""fixed it"" but three months later, again the same identical problem happened: no picture, no internet, message saying ""there is something wrong,"" frowny face, shuts down. The computer was not able to turn on. I got on the phone, listened to their little music for hours, gave up, tried again, wait again, tried again, all in all took me one week to get someone on the phone from India who spoke bad English, who promised someone will call me in 48 hours. Many 48 hours went by and no one called."
"I purchased a Lenovo laptop y70-50 in Nov 2014. I use my laptop just to use design softwares and to watch movies. Last week the laptop crashed with no prior warning. I lost all the data to the projects I was currently working on. I have given the laptop to the service center as it was still under warranty. I asked of my data could be retrieved. I was told it would cost me quite a bit to have my data retrieved. Not an amount I can afford. Apart from the inconvenience of my work bring put on hold, I do not get my data back either? It's the least that could be done."
"So here is my story of Lenovo: In April I broke my 5 year old dell laptop and had to get a new one. My ex gf suggested I buy Lenovo flex considering the product looked solid enough and the fact that the guy at office max told us that in the 3 years he has been there no one has ever returned a Lenovo Laptop. Within the first couple days my password to my Laptop stopped working, so I called customer service. (worse idea ever) They are not helpful! They wanted me to buy a premium service BS for 19.99 a month just so they could help me. What they ended up doing was having me reset my laptop a simple fix and problem solved right? Oh btw they did ask me to give them my email address which I repeated at least 6 times. Minded you none of those people talked any english."
"I bought a new Lenovo yoga 2 pro laptop in December 2014. This new pc was giving me issues right after return policy was over! Things like boot manager failed, blue screen in the middle of the work process, losing data.. Called customer service about 20 times over the past three months - nothing changed except they deleted my files one time when trying to fix it. Finally changed to a different laptop today and was planning to send this one into warranty repairs. Guess what!? Easy transfer is not working either on this garbage!!! Called cust service AGAIN to get help with file transfer and to send back the yoga piece of trash - 2 hours on the phone, nothing is resolved yet... Lenovo corporate has to do something to fix it."
"I purchased a 900 dollar ultrabook, 8gb ram, i7. This is the worst laptop ever. I bought this to produce music and DJ and it just has USB dropouts constantly, which is a big no-no. I'm going to sell it and buy a macbook pro, like I should have in the first place. DON'T BUY!!! BUYER BEWARE, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."
I purchased a Lenovo computer back in February 2015 and this the worst computer I have ever purchased. The computer was filled with pop-ups and spyware. I had to download a program to remove all the junk that was on my computer. By far it's one of the slowest computers I've used. My HP that cost half as much is much better. In addition their customer service is incredibly slow. As I type this I have been on hold for 18 min and 25 sec waiting to pay off my account and end this relationship. I should have been more wary from the very beginning. I bought my computer first and had to endure a multitude of calls to prove I am the right person. So then I was stupid enough to order my wife a computer and endured the same nonsense. I will never again purchase a single item from this company.
"In Jan 2015 I bought a Lenovo 50-70 series from Mumbai. The laptop has been faulty for the past few days. My complaint number registered with Lenovo technical support help desk is **. The serial number of this laptop is C B 334 62 838. The laptop has been remotely supported by tech support team for several hours on multiple number of days when I have called for help May 30th, May 28th, May 27th. Problem that even though I have full WiFi, I cannot get on the internet and web pages do not open. Your tech support help desk has helped me to uninstall the drivers, re install the drivers, delete chrome, made me hard boot the computer 4 times. This has been done for many hours with tech support."
"I bought new Lenovo G50 on May 10, 2015 and its motherboard crashed in two weeks. Customer service centers are so irresponsible as they won't guide us what to do. Wrote mail to **, and that was also not responded properly. Approached chennai service centers, they don't even bother to tell us what is wrong with the system. Very unhappy with the product and lost the product price in 2 weeks."
"I purchased a Lenovo laptop (ThinkPad T540p) with Windows 7 operating system through a Lenovo representative who recommended the best laptop for my needs. At no time was there any mention of a 15% restocking fee if the computer was returned. Within hours of receiving the laptop, it was apparent some of the features promised were not correct (the laptop was heavier than the specs indicated and the laptop's performance was sluggish). I was online with an iYogi representative. He and I had reservations since it appeared the computer was refurbished rather than new."
"Lenovo All in One computer B40-30 Multi-touch- I purchased this computer in December of 2014. My son who is a computer tech set it up. Unable to connect to Wi-Fi, used cable connection. Have been using for 6 months and noticed it was always very slow and frequently it took several attempts before it would open with a message stating ""The proxy server isn't responding"". Most of the features of this computer I am unable to use. While this was annoying, I primarily use this computer for surfing the internet, facebook.com, and e-mail. In other words my enjoyment and general information. Yesterday I decided to contact Lenovo support to find out why I could not connect to Wi-Fi and remedy the problem of slow response. I have a tablet of another brand name and a smart phone which have no problem connecting to Wi-Fi and are immediate in response."
"Our school district purchased the Lenovo ThinkPad X131e for each student in grades 6 through 12. A disproportionately large number of students are experiencing issues with the left hinge, specifically breakage and/or the hinge pulling apart from the case, often with subsequent cracking of the case in that area. Lenovo is aware of the problem and seems to be dealing with it on a case by case basis, but has not recalled the X131e despite it happening on a large scale."
Lenovo Ideapad flex15 developed a problem with the keyboard first. Not all keys would work. I could still use the screen to touch type. But two days later the screen started to pixelate when I would stream video. I called customer support in the USA where I purchased the laptop. They gave me a telephone number for repair in Australia where I was at the time. I called the number and gave the customer support rep the same info. Both reps were very courteous. But I was surprised when I was told that my warranty would not be honored because I did not have an international warranty. They informed me that I would need to call the USA and pay for an international warranty or pay to return my computer to the USA. I asked if they knew how much the international warranty would be. The rep said she did not know but that they (Australia) would still have to ship it to the USA because they did not stock the parts for my model!
"Purchased a Lenovo C40 desktop computer from Best Buy. When you buy a new computer in 2015 you assume that it is loaded with enough security software to protect you. 3 week old it got a massive virus that whipped out the entire windows operating system, and had to pay $200.00 to the Geek Squad to reload windows. I only use the computer for emailing and facebook, so how could this happen to a 3 week old computer, when I have had computers for years and years, without episode."
"I have purchased Lenovo Z50-70 (i7, 8gb ram and 4gb graphic card) but I'm not satisfied with my laptop. It doesn't feel like an i7. It doesn't even play the 4k files properly. Apart from this, there was an offer from Lenovo regarding the powerbank and additional 2 year warranty and I have applied for this offer on their websites and have email them the particulars many times but they have not provided me this offer."
"The Lenovo All in One keeps a losing my registration and I have to fill in all the information over and over again. The last time this happened, the 'All in One' was instantly changed to a 'Laptop'. My internet security was changed without me knowing. Any software that I downloaded was erased and all the information is lost. All of my genealogical information, pictures, and documents are lost. I can not use any of the back-ups that I created because the 'Laptop' operating system will not recognize the back-ups. Lenovo support is useless and a total waste of time."
"I purchased a Lenovo 740 All-in-One and 2 days later I got a message that my computer had been compromised and to call a telephone number. This was when I started Internet Explorer. My computer was locked, keyboard and mouse unresponsive. I restarted the computer but neither my keyboard or mouse would work. Basically the ""virus"" locked out my USB port. I corrected that problem by using another USB port but still could not run Internet Explorer(IE). Called Lenovo Tech Support and a rep logged on to my computer. After an hour she told me I would have to go to 2nd level support and pay $129 to correct the problem."
"I purchased the Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro in two weeks ago. I had problems in turning on power. Sometimes, it works, but other times, I had to try to push the power button more than 20 times and press it longer than a minute. Today, I contacted the Lenovo service center and ask to fix this. They said that I need to send it back to Korea since I purchased it from Korea. They said that they don't have the right part, but that was just an excuse."
"When order online, the website said ""in stock and will ship within 5 - 7 days."" 4 days later, checking the order status it say ""will ship on the 10th day and will delivery on the 15th day."" Chat with Customer service the man name ** said ""Sorry the information is incorrect. It will ship on May 5th."" I said, ""this is incorrect because I order on April 28th."" Asking for his employee ID and he refused to provide, asked for his full name he refused to provide to due to security??? Call customer service and the girl name ** now said, ""will ship on the May 8th, 2015."" Asked her employee ID and full name then she reject to provide. Asked to talk to manager, and she said ""the manager is busy now"" and will call me back before 9 PM eastern time. But now is 8:55 PM no one call me yet. What's going on with the Lenovo customer service? Is that the way customer service get trained to treat customer like that?"
"I just bought 2 Lenovo laptops. Worst purchase EVER! I use my computers for work. I called their support and both times the only answer that I have gotten was ""You need to buy this software program for $199.99."" They told me that my email has been compromised from someone in Nigeria and Canada. BS! I haven't even sent an email with this computer yet and my old HP is working fine. They have not fixed any issue that I've had with 2 new computers. I will be returning both computers! DO NOT BUY THESE! I should have stuck with HP or Dell."
"On 3rd March 2015 - I purchased a Lenovo Y70-70 laptop for £1,199.00. Shortly after the purchase, I spent two days deleting all unnecessary bloatware and installing my own software, set-up emails etc. only to find that the laptop's wi-fi receiver wasn't working properly. I telephoned Lenovo Technical Support. They tried a number of troubleshooting solutions which didn't work. One of these solutions included restoring the laptop to its original settings which meant that the two days I had spent configuring it was lost. He finally concluded that it would need to be sent away for repair."
"A z410 ideapad was purchased March 24, 2014 for one adult user, no gaming. In February 2015, after technical difficulties, Customer Support claimed the laptop had to be reset to the original company settings. The machine worked slowly after that, both online and off, eventually freezing at the log-in screen. After several calls to CS out of country, the case was escalated to a ""manager"", **, in North Carolina. This company representative only left two calls on the home number, and claimed to have sent two emails that were never received. All calls to this representative went to voice mail. The out of country customer support insisted on the machine being sent to Texas, on my own dime, for inspection. It is under warranty until 3/2017. I am reluctant to send due to other reviews online."
"Have Ideacentre Flex 20. Great little AIO; however, nothing but problems. Returned unit in first month and am on KB #3. Waiting for ""Engineer"" to call me back now. KBs are absolute junk. Stick, mistype. Horrendous. However, they are nothing compared to Online Tech Services. I am 68 years old, a retired entrepreneur, who has used and bought a gazillion technology solutions. In all my years, no one comes close to the horrific service capabilities of the new Lenovo. Simply put, they can't speak or understand English. Front line can't solve the simplest problem w/o 3 minutes on hold. Worst, worst, worst. I like the functionality of my unit; but, would try very hard to find elsewhere. I don't know who runs Tech Services at this outfit; but, they need a new career."
"We purchased a laptop from Lenovo last year. We were told on the website it would be delivered in 7 to 10 days. They contacted us during this time to let us know there was a backlog and it would be 8 to 12 weeks. The laptop was needed so we went and purchased one locally. The very next day, we receive word from Lenovo that our laptop has been shipped. We contacted Lenovo and they told us to just ship it back when we received it, which occurred on the same day it was delivered. They received the laptop back on Nov 13 and we were charged about 3 weeks later. It took us until Jan 15 to get our money refunded which caused financial hardship during the holidays since it was $962."
"I have used the Helix 2 tablet for a year now and had to replace the dock (FRU 03X6583) twice. First of all, the part is highly unreliable. Second, even though I have purchased an extended two-business day warranty, they have never resolved a case in two days. During the second, very recent case, all customer service reps in Atlanta were extremely rude, one even hung up on me because I could not locate the serial number of my tablet quickly enough (it is not printed on the case). When I finally spoke to a supervisor, he told me that he would send out a new dock right away. When I received that package, it turned out to be a spare part for a dock and nothing more."
"We bought a Lenovo Thinkpad L440 with a 3 yr onsite repair warranty October 2014. Six months later, it has stopped working. When we called for on-site service, tech support said we did not have an on-site repair warranty, even though we had all the documentation. They finally sent someone to repair it, but the hard drive the tech brought was no good. Plus, we have spent hours on hold trying to find someone at Lenovo to help. A $1200 purchase, and the product lasted 6 months, with a terrible support experience. Last Lenovo I will buy."
"I bought a C260 All-in-One desktop in December and after a few months noticed that the computer isn't allowing Windows updates. I'm able to install updates and I get a message to restart my computer in order for the updates to take effect, but then upon restart, a message says, ""We couldn't complete the updates. Undoing changes."" I finally called Lenovo today and after an hour on the phone with tech support, the tech was unable to fix the problem. He told me it was a software issue, not a hardware issue, and he gave me the phone number for their ""fee-based software support"". The warranty is for hardware only so if I want software support, I'll have to pay for it. Except for the updates, the computer is working adequately. I took a risk with buying such a cheap computer and this is."
"This Lenovo PC was functioning fine for a few years and then out of nowhere, my user profile got corrupted. And eventually, I was able to log back in with my old username but all my files, pictures documents, music - pretty much everything linked to my user profile was gone. This has never happened to me over the course of using many computers. I started using a 486 Packard Bell many years ago. The Lenovo website is very confusing and offers little to no real support for issues like this unless you are willing to pay, which seems to be the model of self perpetuating businesses nowadays. Offer up a low quality product and make them pay even more to fix it when it breaks. I am very frustrated with the lack of even being able to send a complaint to the company about this issue."
"My family bought me a Lenovo Z510 with the I7 processor and 8 GB Ram. My wife and I have used Lenovo and IBM Thinkpads in the past and have referred others to products similar from Lenovo. This past week my Z510 just up and died. I took it to work with me like I have done everyday for the past year, turned it on - it made a weird noise and died. The warranty just happen to expire in January, so there's no chance that talking to Lenovo is going to do me any good. My wife's Lenovo is acting up too - she has a V570 and has to on numerous occasions restore it because of software issues. We both are going to be more cautious in the future about buying Lenovo products."
"I purchased a new Lenovo laptop in late June. 10 days later the hard drive died, and it was replaced by the retailer. Now 9 months later it died, dead, flashing power light but nothing else. I sent it back to Lenovo on March 17th, arriving in their Texas facility on the 20th. They called on Sunday to say it was ""beyond economic repair"" and wanted to know if I wanted them to send it back. I returned the call on Monday the 23rd, We discussed the issue, they say it had been wet, and sent photos of a corroded mother board. I said it had never been wet while I owned it. They said they would escalate the issue."
Their customer service obviously is outsourced. No one can speak or understand English. My new computer idea centre has been down for 3 1/2 weeks. Support can't even help me install the operating system. Why do I have to load it? Still on phone for 2 hours. Never again.
"The hinge on my son's laptop broke and the company said it was a design fault. They said that they would collect it and repair it within two weeks. It was collected by DPD on 5th November 2014. After many phone call, e-mails, pathetic excuses etc., it was eventually returned 10th February 2015. (A mere 14 weeks.) The computer appeared to have been re-assembled with a hammer. It was returned to Lenovo on 27th February. It now appears to have been mislaid/not delivered back (even though we have documentation), not our responsibility etc. etc. etc. This company at best is a waste of space, at worst conduct fraudulent business practices. DON'T BUY THEIR PRODUCTS."
"I went to the Lenovo website to order a docking station for my X230. I found a product that was advertised as supporting it, so I ordered it. When it arrived, it was clearly not compatible. Customer service processed the return and forwarded me to sales. I told the sales rep that answered what I was looking for, and he said that they don't make docking stations for the X230. I began to tell him that the one I purchased was advertised as supported, and his reaction was to say ""yeah, uh-huh"" and hung up on me. I would expect a sales rep to be better than that. I don't think I will be trying to work with them again."
"Lenovo flex - On several occasions the touch screen stopped working and I contacted Lenovo, the first was to uninstall the drivers, this fixed it for three days. The next time I did a complete reinstall of the operating system, it worked for a week. It had passed the 30 days return window at this point and now I have to ship it back to get repair at my expense. When I complained about this expense I was told I should have read the warranty terms before purchasing the product. But they are on the inside of the box."
Their customer service is in Philippines. After spending 15 or more minutes to talk to someone they can't hear me and I can't understand them. I am angry! They need to have people in the US!!!!!!
"I paid around $700 dollars for mine about a year ago right after being tricked by the Staples employee that they were better than Dell (which was what I was looking for but they were all sold out). I take very good care of all my electronics but that wasn't enough to save this computer. I brought it home and after using it for the first time I noticed that almost all the screws on the bottom of the computer had come loose and were sitting on my lap. About a week later the top of the laptop and the inside half began to separate due to the clips inside not doing their job right, so the laptop spent most of its life being taped together (which surprisingly the tape actually held up pretty well)."
"Mobile Lenovo P780 Motherboard parts - Since 15 days I have submitted my handset in service center, but still there is no response yet received from Lenovo. I am definitely going escalate this matter with consumer forum for losing time and money. So many calls on Lenovo service number 18601803425. I urge everyone if facing the same issue to escalate right away with consumer forum for faster resolution."
I bought a new Z710 laptop in mid Dec 2014. She's a powerhouse but I found that the wireless connection would turn itself off intermittently. I had seen something like this on older laptops that used Nvidia GPUs. So I applied the same fix here and now the wireless works flawlessly. The Nvidia GPUs add a power management option allowing the system to turn off the wireless capability to conserve power. I'm not sure why Nvidia still allows this after multiple years of user aggravation caused by this.
"Ever since my husband bought a Lenovo Yoga it's had issues. The first issue experienced was the trackpad intermittently working. The other issue didn't start until a couple of months after purchase - it would randomly freeze up. It eventually died completely and would not turn on at all, no matter if it was plugged into the charging cord or not. It was sent back to Lenovo and they have had it for about 6 weeks now and the last update received on it was on November 20th which was over a month ago. I am telling everyone I know to stay away from this crappy company with their crappy technical support that takes forever to fix problems. I could understand if it was an issue caused by my husband or I and it taking this long to fix but since it's a known defect with the manufacturer, they need to be more proactive and either give us an update they will keep their word on or give us a new freaking laptop!"
"We had a Lenovo yoga laptop go dead, under warranty. Contacted Lenovo service (which appears to actually be an outsource in Grapevine TX), set up a case # and got an RMA # and FEDEX label. On the phone they collected all pertinent info (phone, email, serial #, model, etc. Shipped it off to them on FEDEX today. They touted the fact that they had an online status system which would be automatically updated at all events (arrival, triage, parts, etc.) both on their website and via email to me. After we saw that FEDEX had delivered and had a receipt signature, we looked on the web site - nothing. WE shipped on Monday, delivered Wednesday at 9:00am, and on Friday at COB they still had no status. They did not know that they were in possession of the shipment. This ignorance continued until about Wednesday of next week, when they finally posted a status that said ""they have not received the unit""."
"Try to buy a laptop online. I Made the payment with my usual debit card. The money was taken and my bank gave me an order number. Three days later I receive an email from Lenovo saying that my order was cancelled, no reason was given. So I called customer services. Laura told me (first) that Lenovo had two postal addresses for me. Then she said that Lenovo returned the money to my account on Friday. After that, a very rude Vera told me that Lenovo have never received any payment, which made me really upset because I did not got the money in my account for more than a whole week."
"I purchased Lenovo vibe X2 on 21st of November 2014. I started it on 22nd night and then I used it for 2 days. Initially I felt that its getting heat up, but then it was not so high so I didn't found important to bring it to your notice. On 25th morning I got a call on my mobile and then on keeping the call suddenly display went off (it was not even connected to charger while I was talking). From that day onwards still the display is off. And mobile heats up on charging or usually too."
"Myself, Mr. Chintan ** from Rajkot. I have bought Lenovo S860 smartphone ( IMEI NUMBER 865233020827664) on August-2014 from Umiya mobile, Rajkot, Gujarat. After just 3 months, suddenly mobile was unable to charge due to some technical reasons. Though I have been used only Lenovo original charger to charge mobile. I went to authorized Lenovo service center in my place to repair my mobile on 19th Nov - Anil Services, 33 Silver Chamber, Tagore Road, Rajkot-360002. I have submitted my mobile there to check the issue. In Job sheet, they have mentioned that my mobile is in warranty period so service is free of charge. They told me that they will inform about issue from my alternate contact number but there is no call from there for 2 days. So, I have to go there again to ask them about status of my mobile. They told me My mobile's charging socket was damaged but There is no any damage detected in charging socket."
"I have had two IBM laptops years ago and had NO problems. Deciding to replace Sony Vaio in 2013 I bought a Lenovo E430, and it was the worst experience in buying anything. I could not get them to fix a bad popup message that repeatedly came up and prevented seeing anything in the center of the screen. I bought a service subscription for $180 and after three calls gave up. They would spend an hour trying to get my e430 to install a remote app to work on mine, and a couple of hours later, never fixed anything."
"Has an i5 chip and upgraded to 8 gigs of RAM but computer was slow from the beginning and now locks up even with Norton running. It was slow before Norton and now is slow and locks up. Deleted it for McAfee, and still a problem."
"I Purchased a Lenovo P780 phone in May 2014 for its promised long battery life - although the sound quality and looks were a compromise from day one. Still worse is their Lenovo service experience which I am experiencing since 30th October 2014. My phone started dropping both the carriers signals and I deposited it in the last week of October 2014 for repair with their service center in Navi Mumbai. Thereafter it was a tale of parts not received from Lenovo!! Their franchisee call center threw up their hands and said if you get angry, call up Lenovo!! It was a nightmare to get through their call center."
"Recently I buy new Lenovo laptop I am a part of Diwali offer. In this offer 2-year laptop warranty will be extended and another offer is Lenovo power bank. I have to pay 1099 for that. I tried a lot to contact customer service but it's ringing continuously, no one picked phone. Suddenly yesterday one man picked up phone and told me for pay them for the offer and he also told that he will mail me after got payment. I paid them yesterday but still don't get any mail from them. What is now? How can I extend my warranty and how can I get my power bank? This is really worst service providing by Lenovo."
"I have an L540 laptop, to start Lenovo failed to put indicator lights on the function key i.e. caps lock, numlock. Instead when you hit caps lock, a message would pop up on the screen indicating caps lock on. Those messages stopped coming on so I searched the manual and the Lenovo site for instructions on how to reactivate this function to no avail. I called Lenovo and spent an HOUR being transferred from person to person trying to help address the problem. Finally I was transferred to someone who said he could help on this software issue for $69.95, at that I said ""screw you guys, I'm going home"". To start it was Lenovo's poor design ideas on the machine and then $69.95! This is my first and last piece of Lenovo equipment."
Wanted to get the raid manager working on a TS140 Server. Something that should be simple especially for a server product. (Intel's labyrinth of a site didn't help either. With their 5 different raid managers for different chipsets continuously renamed so they could sound more impressive.) Waited two hours for support that never picked up and then gave up. Its say's 24/7 support but I don't think anyone ever explained to Lenovo that does not mean wait 24/7 long for support. Must have been lost in translation when IBM sold this business to Lenovo. (In all fairness it was late but 24/7 support - should mean staffed call centers instead of 1 person strategically placed in Alaska.)
"I ordered a Lenovo yoga - two weeks later they had not delivered. When following up it turns out that UPS had lost it, then spend 3 weeks trying to get it straighten out. Lenovo never took responsibilities. Cancelled the old order and then ordered a new one - this time they delivered but no operating system was installed. Now it has been already over a week and they cannot manage to send a shipping label so I can return the laptop. The folks at the call center are friendly but are useless as they have no authority to make decision."
"Lenovo g500 - Was using my laptop, browsing the internet then I went out for about fifteen minutes. When I got back my laptop was in sleep mode. Tried to turn it back on but couldn't. I removed the battery then tried again. Now my laptop doesn't turn on anymore."
"Late 2012 I bought a Lenovo u400 laptop and I had no problems except that this piece of ** aluminum paperweight gets really ** hot. Then in 2013 my whole system died, and I wasn't able to boot. I've sent to Lenovo's support, it cost a ** lot. They took a ** long time and guess what? The laptop returned with multiple scratches on the back of the laptop (also, they broke my ssd and made me buy another). Well when it came back I installed Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit with the original serial, and I can't get the ati driver to work (6470m and Intel 3000 HD). I've been asking multiple times for help on the forums and no one ** answers. NEVER EVER I REPEAT NEVER!!! BUY A LENOVO PRODUCT .** LENOVO, ** THEIR STAFF AND ** THEIR PRODUCTS. -200/10 worst branding ever."
"I bought a laptop from Lenovo. They said it would be a month and and a half before they could ship it to me. I thought it was a long time, but the shipping was free so I could wait. A month and a half later I get an email saying it would take another two months to ship it to me. I called Lenovo three times before I got a straight answer and I finally just cancelled the order. I was done with Lenovo. BUT I paid with a debit card and they kept a pending transaction on my debit card for a week. Finally it came off, and I was happy. Today, I look on my account, and staring at me in the face is that looming pending transaction. This means that because the transaction might happen I can not use that money. On top of that, they emailed me and told me my order was shipping out a week after I had cancelled it. I just want to be left alone. Go away Lenovo."
"This place is too short for explaining my experience with Lenovo India but I will try to jot down the main issues. I bought the laptop Lenovo model G510, LP serial number: CB25974151 with a mindset of happy services at my end, but it drastically changed to disappointing one. The services are so poor that made me lodge a complaint at the center. The complaint number was provided to me (**) with an assurance to fix the faults encountered at the earliest."
"I ordered a Think Pad on 5/21/14. I was told a price initially, but I was charged $2 more. That was no big deal, so I said nothing. 2 days later I get a fraud alert from my credit card company asking about a suspicious charge. I had supposedly made another additional purchase that was about $40 less than my actual original purchase. Of course this was NOT a charge which I approved, so I destroyed my card and my credit card company did not allow that charge to go through."
"This PC H500S works fine and is completely silent. However Lenovo have by design placed restrictions on what the end user can do with their purchase. The PC comes pre-loaded with Windows 8.1 and as I understand it Microsoft gives people the legal right to downgrade if you so desire. That's where the problems commence. Lenovo have built restrictions into the BIOS which if you try to convert your Hard Disk Drive from GPT to MBR using third party software such as Easeus Partition Master, you will find that the BIOS prevents loading of Keyboard and Mouse Drivers so your software is rendered inoperable. The same occurs if you try to load a Windows command prompt. You can input the instructions but it will not perform the requested commands."
"I did a massive amount of research, before I thought I smartly chose Lenovo last December. In 9 months, the inside case cracked off and my keyboard died. I called and was told these things were under warranty and they would send me a box to (freely) send it back. I would have it returned to me, fixed, in 6 business days. Except not. They called in about 4 days to tell me none of that was covered under my warranty. Somehow I did this to my computer (I must have smashed the inside case while I was swimming with it). I would have to pay $300, which seems like a LOT to pay for a keyboard (I've had them replaced for $100 before). Two days later and they call to tell me that they need to wipe it clean. I asked if they can back it up, they say no, they don't do that. They could send it back to me and I could do that. But they wouldn't recommend it. I tell them I need to think about it. They call the next evening. What do I want to do? I call them the next morning, get disconnected, call again, request a technician calls me. Finally in the afternoon, one does."
G500 - My laptop just went off and on restarting. It won't boot past the lenovo logo. It loops incessantly. Help.
"I took All Premium Support. Services are included in the Annual subscription: Configure security settings including firewall, Windows updates and anti-virus software; Install software; Diagnose operating system issues including providing operating system repair or reinstall; Diagnose and remove virus and malware; Setup and troubleshoot wired or wireless network. When I reached on Day 5 after Annual subscription for the installation of VM Ware, they have responded that ""we will not support few software installations"". Then I asked for refund on Day 7 -- they have not refunded the amount. I don't recommend strongly."
"I bought a Lenovo Z710 in mid July. Within 2 weeks I had an issue with the computer dropping my internet/browser connection - my Skype connection still works but something within the browser keeps corrupting my configuration (I think). In order to ""fix"" this, I had to pay $200 for a Premium Software Support Subscription (they gave me a couple purchase options) but this overall was the cheapest long term. Lenovo ""fixed"" the problem but it reoccurs every 10-14 days. Their Premium SW support people cannot resolve this ongoing software issue. I have requested a refund for all the money I spent for the computer, the hardware extended warranty, the Software premium support and the MS Office I bought specifically for this computer. I wonder how much they want to extort from me to return this defective product."
"I bought the 430 Thinkpad 9/24/12. Based on the reviews and the price I paid I thought I'd get a reliable laptop. I was wrong. The first problem was the user interface. The laptop used some intrusive in-house software which was no longer supported by Lenovo but was of course still installed on the laptop. The second problem was the battery failing prematurely after just 11 months of usage. Luckily it was still in warranty at that point. The final problem, the one that killed the laptop for me and has made me promise to never buy or advocate buying Lenovo again was the screen failure. This happened 9/30/14. From what I can tell the failure is a defect in the screen itself and is disturbingly common based on what I found with Google. Funny how none of the sparkling reviews for this laptop mentioned this problem."
"I have purchased B340 All-In-One PC. Raised complaint about screen flickering issue on 16th July 2014. Sent at least 10+ emails, numerous phone calls. Lenovo service engineer replaced two major parts in two visits, but could not analyze exact cause. Now he is suspecting TV tuner card, which is expected on 17th Oct 2014. For every part delivery, Lenovo has taken 3-5 weeks. In this last 2 months, My PC is down and I am incurring heavy losses. The worst part is there is no proper senior authority, where I can escalate the matter. All services are given on contract to another company and no one is responsible. Reputed company takes 2 months to resolve their own product issue! And customer is just waiting. Please take my sincere advice, do not ever buy Lenovo products. Lenovo just do not bother about customer problems. So far I have written emails to 9+ persons in Lenovo at various levels. But no one actually solved my problem nor even given any commitment when it will be solved."
"I had the very unpleasant experience of having to deal with Lenovo customer service. My laptop is 2 months old. All of a sudden the Wi-Fi was not showing up to give me a choice as to what router to which I wished to be connected. Lenovo advised that despite my warranty, I would have to pay for their support. What a joke. I am now in the process of returning my Lenovo product as I never want to deal with that company again. If you think you might need customer service STAY AWAY FROM LENOVO."
"I have always had little glitches here and there with internet explorer and websites freezing up since I've got this from Staples, who weren't any help at all. When it locked me out totally and even with a reboot would not give me my desktop, their non English speaking, tech supporter swore even though I only had this computer for 4 months protected by AT&T UVERSE's MCAFEE's virus protection. I must have downloaded a virus and their warranty would not apply. I could send it in or take it somewhere and get it fixed, but at my expense. I told her, ""The only problem I have was my choice of computer"" and hung up. Twenty minutes later I figured out how to get to task scheduler and from there was able to go to system restore and go back to well before all this started. No thanks to LENOVO, I'm back online, but it is still a piece of crap and if I could make them take it back and give me my money back, I would."
"Don't EVER BUY Lenovo computer products! Sanction Lenovo! My husband bought me a brand new laptop B560 On January 1st 2011 for my 50th birthday from a Best Buy Store IN BOYNTON BEACH FLORIDA. Now, after a 3 and a half years I still have the same OLD PROBLEMS!!! The LCD starts flickering, the computer shuts down suddenly, I have delay typing, the cursor goes up and down without giving a command, closes and open ups windows I have not requested and much more! I called Geek Squad and Best Buy for help over a hundred of times, they try to fix it but after a few days the computer does their thing again! I called Geek Squad again today, and they cannot provide any assistance either. I tried the live chat on Lenovo website for technical support. They could not help me either."
"Did buy a Lenovo IdeaPad p400 for granddaughter. Now I find that battery can not be removed nor can I find one to buy. If you will mail me where to buy a battery and how to remove backing, then this will not be the last time I buy your product. Thanks."
"I bought this laptop believing that it would be a long term buy. After about 10 months, the battery reduced to just 50 mins from 4 hours. The company also makes sure there is no chance to use a 3rd party battery so you are forced to return to them. The strange drop in battery life coupled with the chip in the machine I believe is a dishonest attempt to scam customers. Here in South America, the battery cannot be found anywhere so this means one ends up with a machine that has no use except near an electrical point. Customer support are useless in South America and they try only to sell goods to you and not support them, after they are bought. I wasted good money and will avoid buying this brand again."
"Sept 2013: Ordered Thinkpad Laptop. Finally received it a month later! FYI: Hate the touchpad but I'm dealing with it. December 2013: Sent Thinkpad back  b/c an intermittent shadow kept appearing on screen. They returned it fixed same week. Excellent! Feb 2014 Fan emitted burnt smell - Laptop Dead. Sent it for initial repair. Lenovo sent it back a week later - STILL NOT WORKING! Claims they tested it??  I Sent it back again: 2 weeks & several parts later (motherboard etc) - STILL DOESN'T BOOT UP - fan goes on about 2 seconds - same burnt smell, then NOTHING! STILL DEAD **!!"
"I ordered Lenovo laptop online on Dec 7 (at around 2:00AM). When I woke up in the morning I found better offer and called Lenovo immediately to cancel the order. They told me it already went through, but I should not worry, because they sent an e-mail to the factory and the order will be cancelled there. Just in case I receive the e-mail with the confirmation that laptop has been shipped anyways I should call them and they will reroute it back to their warehouse."
"I bought a Lenovo laptop for my college bound son 18 months ago and it has been nothing but trouble. For the past 4 months, it had been freezing and took forever to search for anything, now it doesn't start at all. I called customer service and they told me to restore computer. We have restored and restored sometimes as many as 6 or 7 times in 1 night and its still useless. Can't believe I wasted my hard-earned cash on such a piece of trash. I also have a Lenovo tablet that I bought at same time and it hasn't worked in a year. I will NEVER buy a Lenovo product again and I will make sure my family and friends don't either. You might as well throw your money in trash."
"I ordered a new laptop from Lenovo on-line. I received a confirmation email from them, and an estimated date that the computer would be delivered. Without giving me any notice, Lenovo cancelled the order! I called the number on the confirmation email, and was transferred to Mexico. After being on hold over 20 minutes, someone finally answered. I explained the problem, and was informed that Lenovo didn't like the address I provided. After going round and round with him about the lunacy of the policy, and how it was not okay for Lenovo to dictate to its customers where they should have a product they paid them for shipped to, I asked to speak to someone in the US."
"I purchased a Lenovo Thinkpad T430s in month of November 2013. After 5 days I had issues with the battery. I contacted customer service to return the laptop and get refund. He insisted that he will send me a new battery and there was no need to return the Lenovo for refund. Since it was my first time purchase from Lenovo, I agreed to his idea. After getting the battery the problem didn't resolved. The battery life was way below the life that company promised on its website. Also, a couple of issues arised like grainy images from webcam and intermittent internet connectivity because of faulty wireless card. I again called the customer executive and he sent me a new battery and told me that I have to send the laptop to get it repaired."
"I purchased a new Lenovo laptop in September 2013. This was a touch screen and I liked it and it seemed to work fine. Every time I moved it, I noticed screws on the table. My husband and I would just replace the screws, then one day when I opened the laptop, the screen came apart at the seam. I was worried about dust getting in it, so I tried to push it back together. At that time my screen cracked. I sent it back and they told me sorry not covered under warranty. They told me I should have sent this back as soon as I saw the seam coming apart, so now it will not be covered under warranty and want $360 to repair it... Very poor customer service."
"In August of 2013 I purchased a Lenovo T430 for my college bound daughter at a cost of 1400.00 which included 400.00 for a next day, on site service agreement. I purchased the 4 year next day, on site service agreement so that my daughter would be able to get a tech to help her at school. On Jan 13, 2014 the computer crashed and would not even startup. Lenovo decided that the hard drive needed to be replaced. For some reason Lenovo told me that the hard drive was not covered by on site service agreement and that my daughter would have to install it herself. Luckily, she was home for winter break."
"I was originally going to buy a Surface Pro 2 but after talking to a sales person who said that Lenovo was a better deal, I bought a Lenovo Ideapad Yoga Ultrabook on November 28, 2013. Immediately upon removing it from the box, the letter D key fell off the keypad. I boxed it up took it back to Best Buy who informed me I had to send it into Lenovo to have it repaired. They couldn't give me a refund or a new computer since it was a repairable part. I contacted Lenovo and they sent me an email with a printing label to have it shipped back to them. They said it should only take 5-7 working days to repair."
"I ordered the Lenovo Y510 for use at work in an environment that is graphics intensive and reliability and ruggedness a must. Customer service before and after the sale was excellent. I talked with USA-based customer service rep. The Y510 has proven to be powerful and rugged. I really like the keyboard and mouse pad as well as the graphics, bright non-glare display and overall ease of use. Speakers are amazing for a laptop. I purchased 3 year on site warranty and accidental breakage coverage as this laptop will travel with me 6 days a week for work. The build quality is excellent. I am a former Dell XPS customer who became very dissatisfied with Dell's horrible customer service. I inspected Lenovo's customer service by contacting them before purchasing. In all cases they were helpful, insightful and pleasant. I am a very happy Lenovo Y510 customer who will continue to purchase their products for my family and recommend them to the schools I work with."
I have a bought a Lenovo computer and it packed up after two years and can't be restarted and is totally dead. This happened very suddenly and froze. I tried to restart unsuccessfully. So I tried to reset it at factory default settings. When it restarted after that I got the Blue Screen of Death. The computer is totally toast and can't be restarted. All the data on it is lost. I am never buying a Lenovo. This is the worst computer I've ever had.
"I purchased a Lenovo H430 10 months ago. It starts with a system error message and says it is going to start the repair process. Nothing happens. It would not restore the system or return it to the shipped configuration. We called Lenovo, they were very helpful for about 30 minutes then said it couldn't be fixed. The entire desktop had to be returned not just the drive. We sent proof of purchase and waited. After no response from Lenovo, we called and gave the incident #. They had no idea what the number was, or had any interest and hung up. We called back and they said they couldn't help even though it was in warranty. Another piece of cheap Chinese garbage. I'm going to blow it up with a 4-pound jug of Tannerite. At least I will have some satisfaction."
"The Lenovo will break down randomly, customer service through Lenovo is the worse. You can't ask them questions they do not want you to ask. My Lenovo comes with a 1-year limited warranty which my computer would break down throughout the year I had it. Now that it is 1 year and 1 month old, it has broken down beyond my repair. There is nothing Lenovo will do. I was unable to get an extended warranty while it was under a year and no, that it is over a year old. There is nothing they will do to fix it."
"I was given as a gift a Lenovo G700 Laptop; in a nutshell, the computer worked slowly from the time I took it out of the box. I contacted Lenovo, Micro Center, and Microsoft for help in resolving the issues. Lenovo staff were polite but ineffective. I went to an outside source to check for problems with the machine - as I had spent the entire warranty period complaining and asking for help from the about three entities. I will be filing a complaint with the Maryland Consumer Protection Agency as I believe there are systemic problems with the machine and problems in getting all three entities to honor their warranties. If the computer had not been a gift, I would have returned it the second I took it out of the box and would have asked my credit card company to reverse the charges."
"I purchase Lenovo S400 in June - 2013. From purchase laptop battery life is only 45 minutes. Then going for plug in and recharge 100% but again discharge in 40-45 minutes. I complain 3 times to company but complaint officer is given answer that Lenovo S400 battery life is only 1 hour, so we are not replace or do anything. When I purchase marketing officer say for 3 to 4 hour battery life and complaint officer say only 1 hour. How pathetic answer. This is not 10 Rs product which I destroyed. I purchase in 34,000 Rs. which is very high. And company not given feed back on this. Whenever you are going with laptop you always find plug for recharge your laptop battery. So I request you all consumers who want purchase Lenovo products. Please don't buy. Company hasn't policy after sales service. So never resolving your complaint after purchase. If you have any doubt about this complaint so feel free to talk with me."
"I wrote to customer service, will call if no response...my tech put touch freeze on to help but it is getting worse!"
"Bought my first Lenovo in 2007. First one sales & service were great so I bought another one in 2010. Included in the purchase was an onsite next day warranty. Unfortunately had to replace my hard drive and called Lenovo to use my warranty. They said they would send me a new hard drive. I replied and confirmed with them that I had a next day onsite warranty. They said replacing the hard drive was too simple to send someone and wouldn't do it. They said, ""You could watch the video on how to install the hard drive."" I replied, ""If the computer is not working how can I watch the video?"" The result is I had to find my own support center, take the hard drive to them, and pay them to run the recovery discs. Next time no Lenovo."
"They shipped my laptop 2 months after they promised. Provided little notification of the delay. When I complained, they offered a $100 credit, then they never followed up on that promise, either. I sure hope the new laptop doesn't break, because I dread dealing with them again!"
"Tonight I ordered a $100 computer from Lenovo. I couldn't pay with PayPal - I have been a member for nearly 10 years so I had to sign up for some extended payment thing just to complete the order. Then when I got the order confirmation e-mail I found that the FREE SHIPPING means that it takes 9 days to ship. The computer I purchased won't even be shipped until Christmas eve - no way it will arrive in time for Christmas. When I tried to call the customer service number I found they are closed - seems like they could have 24/7 service around the holidays. If my daughter were not the one that had chosen this computer I'd cancel the whole thing and buy one from some company that 1) let's me use PayPal to purchase, 2.) can ship is a reasonable time - 9 days is not reasonable, 3) lets me talk to someone when I am curious about my $1500 order. Hope the product is better than the process and customer support to get it."
"The first time I called Lenovo to inquire about promotions and etc., I was told their products were ""top quality"" and to subscribe to the newsletter but to expect to pay at least xyz. In Jan 2012, I received what was supposed to be my ""dream computer"" - it was $1000 on sale. Problems from day one and when I called the company for support thru the warranty, the woman said that particular model is low-end and if I expected speed, I needed a higher quality version. Now, 12GB RAM, 2TB HDD, 8 USB PORTS for ready boost - should be fast. And the wifi adapter has never functioned correctly. I just don't use it. But will never buy from them again. Microsoft diagnosed an improper OEM OS install & as well as disabled services necessary for wifi (went from 3kbps to 58Mbps) but the rest of the repairs will be expensive - when it never worked to begin with. I overestimated my computer repair skills or I would have returned it."
We have purchased g500 laptop after one week screen broken. It is under accidental warranty still. Today 19/11/2013 nobody in service to replace the screen only mail mail. They are playing asking the document every time & excusing parts availability. Purchased date is 2/10/2013. They want all the bio data from us instead of giving the services better to customer means they don't want to give warranty on time. How to teach them a lesson pl. tell asap.
"The first Lenovo Mini I had gave up the ghost to a hard drive failure after 2 years. I loved it until then, and figured it was a fluke. I should have googled them then. Bought a G585 for a decent price in July, and had a hard drive failure this past week. Customer service was the RUDEST experience I think I have ever had. And the guy immediately started giving me hostile threats about the possibility of it not being under warranty. (Yes, it is, and it has never been dropped, gotten wet, or been in any way mishandled.) There was never a single attempt to try and be helpful, and now I am waiting for a battle. Sick to my stomach. I work off my computer every day. Irony of ironies? I am typing this on a Fujitsu that is held together with duct tape, runs XP, has been dropped several times, is 10 years old... and still runs like a freaking top."
"10-28-13 I contacted Lenovo customer service and of course was informed that because it was an ""IdeaPad"" I was unable to speak to anyone other than the Philippines who handles this product. I was told that yes the laptop was under warranty and the part will be shipped out asap. After 10 days, I called to check on the part and was told it had not shipped out yet and they have no reason why it did not. Now I have called every day for now 19 days and have had thing escalated to whoever can do anything about it."
"I've chosen Lenovo as my first brand for a laptop pc. However, I'm very, very unhappy about it. I keep having the ""Blue screen"" error and despite sending it to service for the 4th time, they are unable to solve it. I've requested to change my pc with a new one, but they've refused. I really, really wouldn't recommend this brand to any person I know and I regret my choice. I've been trying to solve this since Spring 2013, but to no avail. I hoped for a better treatment from a huge brand like Lenovo."
"I purchased Lenovo notebook in October 2012 for my daughter who is a senior in college. It crashed twice making her do the labs and all the work again, costing her grade for late turn in. We sent it to Lenovo service twice and was out of computer for 3 weeks and my daughter had to check in and out lab computer every day and wasted over an hour every day to get a computer. Lenovo refused to give her loaner while Lenovo had it for service. Lenovo agreed to replace after it crashed 3rd time in the middle of senior project losing all the data. New computer arrived after 5 weeks from China and new computer crashed after 6 weeks."
"I purchased a Lenovo Yoga computer back in August of this year. On Sept. 23rd, Damage occurred to the computer that was totally my fault. I contacted Lenovo who told me that I needed to pay $80.00 in order to get them to look at the computer. If I agreed to let them fix it, they would deduct the 80 dollars from the total, and have the computer back in seven days. After receiving the call, I paid almost 300 more dollars to them. I waited until the seven days were almost up and did a follow-up call. I was transferred 3 times, held on hold for 15 minutes to be told that a part needed had to ordered and would be in on the 4th of Oct. (which was the date of the call). They said my computer would be shipped back to me on the 21st. I questioned why so long after I was promised it would be returned in seven days."
"I sent my laptop off almost two weeks ago for repairs. There was a request for this repair to be expedited, as it is the second time it's been sent off for the same problem (the first time it was returned 'repaired', the problem hadn't been fixed at all). Repairs haven't even started yet! I've spent hours on the phone, both times I sent in my computer, putting in several complaints and expedite requests and absolutely nothing has happened. I never received any promised calls 'within three business days' regarding my complaints. The first 'repair' took well over three weeks, and the second is shaping up to be the same. I would absolutely not buy Lenovo ever again."
"I purchased a Lenovo Yoga 13 and accessories on 7/21/13. It arrived on the evening of 7/26/13. I turned it on the next day, and within a day, I found the wireless to be defective, plus the computer froze when opening any programs. I decided to return it, and called for a merchandise return authorization on 7/282013. I returned the computer and accessories using their labels the following day. My return shipments were confirmed as received by UPS on 8/5/2013 and 8/7/2013 (and confirmed by Lenovo after I called them)."
"A Complete Cluster ** from the beginning! More than two weeks ago, I tried to purchase a ThinkPad but one thing led to another and I went another route. The first order was discarded immediately because my bank was limiting transactions. Once we found a work-around, finally completing the transaction, still more issues. Things really started getting bad when I called to check the status of charge removal from a previous botched order (they cancel your order but do not release the funds, this is per the bank). I was told there were more problems with the card. This, after being in contact with the bank and finally getting a go-ahead! They evidently took my threat seriously and cancelled my last order, even though I did not specifically say to CANCEL the order. Despite receiving a notice that the most recent order was cancelled, the hold was not released for over 10 days!"
"My PC never worked since the date they shipped. I was on Tech Support calls for hours and finally decided to replace the PC. Sales team never contacted me and, in fact, I was the one who was calling and checking status every time. I'm still waiting for a replacement. Never, never buy Lenovo."
"I have been dealing with Lenovo regarding an order since November of 2012. I ordered a computer via telephone sales at the after Thanksgiving sales price. I received an email saying to contact Lenovo due to a problem with my credit card company since the item was not to be shipped to my home since it was a Christmas gift. I called them within 24 hours and discovered that despite their own message that I had 7 days to contact them or my order might be cancelled that it was already cancelled. I called Lenovo again to reorder and was told the product was sold out, but I could order the more expensive computer if I wished. I called back to speak to a supervisor about the problem with their policy and was told that there was product in the warehouse which the representative said she called and confirmed and would be sent by the end of the first week in December of 2012."
"Lenovo has the worst customer service of any company with which I have ever dealt. My monitor was back-ordered two weeks, yet it took over a month to be shipped to me. I was told that the computer would be shipped in one week, yet it took two weeks. I was told that I would get expedited shipping, yet I did not get it on the monitor. Every time I try to contact customer support, whether by email, phone, or live chat, I get someone from India who has no authority to do more than read written answers, it seems. I wrote a letter to the company headquarters, yet I have not even received a reply. I finally talked with someone in America, who promised me that her American supervisor would call me the next day. That was over a week ago. I keep trying to call the lady who told me that her supervisor would call me the next day, but she has never answered her phone when I called and has never returned any of my phone calls."
"Lenovo is a Chinese company and within 1.5 years, my laptop has died. After the warranty expired, the G460 used to get heated up and now I am stuck. The moral of the story is don't buy Chinese stuff as there is no customer service. You can call and some Chinese lady, not knowing English, will speak. There is no way to file a complaint. Ridiculous."
"I purchased a laptop computer from Lenovo approximately one week ago. I received my laptop earlier than expected. But upon closer inspection, it did not have the options that I had informed the sales associate I had wanted or thought I had ordered. When I contacted Lenovo's customer service department they treated me as if I was a liar, informed me that the computer had the options that were on the receipt and that I had received what I had ordered."
"I have never been made to feel so helpless or worthless when trying to correct a purchase. They cancelled my order without notifying me. Four days after my purchase, I logged in to check my order status and found that it had been cancelled. Not even an email to let me know. After calling, holding, being transferred, holding, being transferred, being disconnected while holding, etc., I found out that my order had been cancelled because my shipping address did not match my billing address. Apparently, there was fine print about that not being allowed that I did not see. Fine, maybe their system shouldn't allow people to make a purchase if their billing and shipping addresses don't match if they don't allow that."
"I purchased a Lenovo laptop on 12/11. On 11/12, the hard drive crashed. I needed recovery discs in order to have the laptop repaired. After many calls to Lenovo which ranged from, call back tomorrow and you will receive the discs in three days, I have still not been contacted or received and discs. I was then forced to purchase Windows 8 in order to get my laptop fixed at Best Buy where I purchased it. Shame on a company for treating customers as poorly as I have been treated. I will never ever buy a product connected to IBM or Lenovo. I have never had such poor customer service in my life and I am 63 years old. One month later, I am still waiting for my recovery discs. You have cost me time and money I should not have had to encounter."
"I ordered a laptop from Lenovo (G780) and paid via Amazon checkout. The laptop arrived about a week later with no battery. I called support and was sent to the inside sales team in India. I was told that they would investigate my claim and get back to me within 5 business days. I told them that that was unacceptable and they sent me to the ""manager"". The manager told me that she understood my situation and said that she would order a new battery to be shipped to me. Within a few hours, I received an email stating the following: ""This is to inform you that I did check with my team for the battery that was not sent to you with the laptop and it looks like we do not have that particular battery and hence, unfortunately we cannot ship one and so the only option that I have for you is to return the machine and have a full refund for the product. If you have any future queries, please do email me back."""
"After decades of wonderful ThinkPads, I bought a Lenovo IdeaPad U260. What a mistake. This otherwise beautiful $900 computer had to have two motherboards replaced in the first year, and now, six months past its warranty, it will not turn on. I assume it has to have another motherboard. I do not mistreat my computers, and this thing has not worked longer than six months since I purchased it. It has been to their repair center in Texas (they kept it for 10 weeks!). The problems I sent it in for were fixed, but it came back with different problems. The home service person who came to fix the new problems broke the screen when trying to replace the motherboard again. The technical department at Lenovo headquarters repaired it by replacing the motherboard and LCD board, but now, six months later, the laptop has just stopped working."
"It always seems like the average brand at first but after months of use, it completely crashes. Not even two years after I first bought my laptop (I don't remember which specific type), the battery stopped functioning to its full capacity and now it replies with ""Consider replacing your battery."" I expected it to last at least 3 to 4 years. On many occasions, icons will be missing from the screen as well as gadgets. Programs will stop responding quite frequently and processes often take longer than it should. I'm not sure why, but I can't even open the command prompt. After going through the exe to open it up, nothing happens."
"I bought a Lenovo G570 notebook at the end of 2011 for $500 (it's now $400). It came with a Synaptics TouchPad, which makes the computer unusable. The left mouse clicker sticks and the touchpad continuously highlights everything I'm typing, then disappears it or moves it elsewhere. Every day is a new adventure in the Lenovo experience. Desktop icons disappear. Every single document in my computer (all created and saved in Microsoft Word) mysteriously changed one day to Microsoft Office, which I hate. Every single document had to be opened and saved again in Word. I am a writer, working on three novels simultaneously, so this has been an ongoing project to restore my documents to their original form. All the left-hand tabs in a document I was working on suddenly switched to right hand tabs and had to be switched back, one by one."
"I ordered a laptop from Lenovo along with a Slim Case. They offered 6 months same as cash through Bill Me Later (PayPal). The Slim Case was delivered but the laptop never came. I contacted Customer Service who took my question and said to wait 1 to 2 business days for a response. Six business days later and not having been contacted, I inquired again. Later that day, I received a response saying the order was canceled due to ""payment issues"". Apparently, credit was denied. This is the first time in my 63 years that I was refused credit and I have excellent credit."
"I ordered a laptop on August 8, 2012, only to learn that the order was cancelled. In trying to learn why, I experienced the worst customer service organization I have ever encountered. The customer service center (India?) is staffed with people who just don't give a damn. On hold calls are usually greater than 45 minutes; you cannot talk to a manager (they will ""call you back"" and never do). I tried sending copies of all documentation to the US Lenovo headquarters twice with zero response. Looks to me like a clear case of management setting the example."
"I have a Lenovo ThinkPad x201 laptop. I bought extended support service from Lenovo (order # **, account # **, payment auth # **). Every time I call (technical support), they say I don’t have warranty. They make me wait for 4 day before someone calls me. I paid the full amount of the money. Why even pay them if they don’t do their work right. In other words, they stole money from me."
"The first one I bought was for my daughter and in the first month it went down and had to be returned to Texas. It went down in less than 4 months after that and again 2 months before warranty was up. Guess what happened just 11 days after warranty was up? You got it - down for good! Well, I just started a new Thrift store with my sister-in-law and she had a friend get us a laptop for the shop. I almost got sick when I saw the Lenovo box. We have had it for 22 days and it just took its first crap. I hate this company - Lenovo."
"One of my friends has a Lenovo laptop. Inspired by his laptop, I bought one model, G570. It is just the third month since I bought this product. My touch pad has stopped working. I have logged a complaint with Lenovo and since it is under warranty, they said it will be replaced. And this was assigned one service company in Bangalore and it took three weeks for them to respond to my complaint. They have replaced the touch pad and it is still not working. After this, I was asked to raise another complaint and the same thing happened again - after one month they responded to my complaint. This time also, they have shipped the same touch pad (I don't know why these Lenovo people ship these touch pads again and again, even after finding that the problem is not with them). Now I have entered the fourth month. Out of the four months usage of my worst laptop, one month is without mouse only. So, friends, never go for this worst brand. Many of my friends face the same problem; touch pads were not working for more than 2 months."
"My screen got broken from the inside. I called them up and they told me to send a picture, so I did. They told me, ""You are covered by our warranty. Send it back to us."" I sent it back and got a confirmation that they got it and they will fix it, clean it and send me a tracking number to send it back. When I didn't get any notification for about a week, I called them up. They told me, ""No, you are not covered."" So, I told them to please listen to the recorded phone call that we had and they will hear how their company told me after I sent them a picture where they saw very clearly what happened and told me that it's covered under the warranty. The guy told me, ""I don't care what we told you. You don't have to send me the email that you got about the fixing. We have no responsibility to do what we told you on the phone so if you want it fixed, it's a $300 charge. The email you got is irrelevant."" I asked him what does he mean and if it was not from Lenovo. He told me, ""Yes, it is from us, but we have no responsibility to it."""
"It's been over a month since I placed my order and Lenovo has still not shipped it! I'm afraid to check the order status because every time I do, the date gets further and further away. And I dare not cancel it! Just read any of the reviews about how much fun that is to do. First, it'll take forever to talk to someone. Second, you have to so ""no, seriously cancel it"" to at least 3 different people. Then you have to wait months for them to credit your account, ** unbelievable. I got burned doing this with one of their little tablets last year, but thought that was a freak event. Obviously, it's not. I will never order a Lenovo computer again."
"I placed an order for a laptop online during tax holiday in NC. After the end of tax holiday, they cancelled my order, mentioning some credit card issue. When I called them back, they said the issue was resolved; however, they have to place a new order. When I asked about the tax liability, the sales representative said we will charge your card with tax however, once the order is shipped, call us back and we shall refund you the tax amount. Now, after several calls they just say we are unable to refund, crab, cheated. Don't believe what they say to you and what they mention in the order history, completely fraud team."
"I ordered a laptop from Lenovo in Jan 2011. I also purchased 3-year accident warranty with it. There has been no problem from my side since I bought this laptop, but the screen started flickering after around 3 months of purchase. I sent it for repairs and it came back after about 3 weeks. I started the laptop and to my surprise, it was still flickering. I sent it back, again for 3 weeks. It worked for about 4-5 months before started flickering again. I sent for repairs again, 3 weeks. It worked again for 4-5 months fine and same problem again. I called up customer care to fix it for good. They said they will replace it and someone from the customer manager team will contact me."
"I bought Lenovo Ideapad Y480 and got it on 8/3/2012. It came with Windows 7 Ultimate Premium. I can't join the company domain. I upgraded to Windows 8. It has many missing drivers that are not in their support site. I've been sending request, from this number to that number, for a copy of the original software from Lenovo. They want me to either pay $59 for the original software to get the driver or pay 1 year $179 for software support. This is the first time I bought this piece of junk. I wasted almost $900. I'll never buy anything from Lenovo."
"I placed an order for a laptop online and canceled the order the next day. I received an email confirming my cancellation. One week later, they shipped the order anyway and charged my credit card. After multiple phone call attempts, they would not credit my account until they received the laptop back and passed their quality inspection. I argued that their error was not my problem and requested an immediate refund. They refused. I refused delivery of the laptop and it was sent back to them. They have had it back for over one week and still no credit. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. Avoid!"
"The Book of Don't! Lenovo has worse customer service than Dell. The hinge stopped working on my G575 laptop a month after purchase. I took the computer in to Fry's and they said I had to deal with Lenovo. I called Lenovo from Fry's and Lenovo wanted me to mail it in - on my dime - and be without a computer for two weeks. When I asked if I could have it done locally, they gave me the names of a bunch of local repair places and told me to start calling. Over the next hour, I called each one and each said they weren't authorized to repair my model. I called Lenovo back. They gave me more useless phone numbers. Finally, California Computer Center said they could do it. So several days later, I took an hour's drive to the place, and when I got there, they said they actually weren't authorized to do my model after all."
"My Lenovo W510 laptop has locked me out of using it to any degree. It will not even boot an operating system due to a bad design. Specifically, when the backup battery (also called the CMOS battery) dies or is temporarily disconnected, all of the boot-up settings are cleared. That is, all but the boot-up menu passwords. This exception is purposely built-in by Lenovo and sets them apart from other manufacturers. In my particular case, this means that my $3,000 laptop cannot boot an operating system because the boot process errors with a message about missing date and time settings. It then redirects me to the log-in screen for my boot-up menu so that I may log-in, and fix the date and time settings. But I have long forgotten the boot-up menu password as I have used this laptop for two years, without problem, and without ever needing the boot-up menu password."
"I received the laptop around December 10, 2011. In May, it would not even respond to being plugged in. I took it to a local ""authorized service center"" where they replaced the system board and the dc inlet. It had to go back to the service center in July when the wireless modem had to be replaced – a two-week wait. They told me that it needed re-imaging. When I called Lenovo as instructed to get the rescue and recovery disks, they chastised me for taking it to a local service center, and said I should have sent it to Ohio. I got the disks, everything was erased. I had to start all over again. Now the Microsoft Word program will not load, they will not give me a key code or send a disk. No disk was included in the original mailing, nor can a code be found. Customer Service sends me to Technical Support who sends me to Sales. Wait time is over 2 hours to talk to anyone, and then they don't speak very clearly. I had to ask for a person who spoke English better three times, and then it was just a different nationality. My opinion is this sucks! My 10-year-old Dell works much better. It’s a shame to spend so much money on a **."
"To all who are considering ordering from Lenovo directly, do not! You have been warned. I originally ordered a Z570 i5 on June 18th. It wasn't until July 10th (after many phone calls, emails and lies from Lenovo reps) that I finally found out that the configuration I ordered had sold out and they wouldn't be making any more of them. I was then offered two substitute laptops (both with inferior specs, one even had ""better graphics"" where the graphics card information should have been). I refused both offers and finally said that I would like to upgrade to the U400 i7 for the same cost or I was going to cancel the order. I was told that would be fine and that it would be put on the priority list. The back and forth with the foreign reps ate up another few days. By this time, the ship date on the website for the U400 said July 18th. I said fine and was given a new order number. Checking the order status a couple of days later showed a ship date of the 19th. One more day, no big deal."
"I placed an order with the help of a salesperson last week. I got an email notifying me of cancellation of order with no explanation. I called customer service to straighten the problem out, waited on hold for 50 minutes (I timed it). I hung up and called sales (they answered on the third ring!). I was told not to re-order, but to call the credit department in the morning as they were unavailable during the evening. When I called the credit department, they said there was no such order in the system. I emailed the salesperson who had sent me the original estimate - with the estimate in the reply. I have not had one person willing to help - no reply. This amount of disconnect and lack of communication would be intolerable in my businesses."
"Right out of the box, issues began with floating cursor, the keyboard did not work properly (space bar, tab, several character keys). I called Lenovo, was on hold then transferred from department to department. Their conclusion was there was something wrong with the laptop. This took them 1-1/2 hours to determine. Their solution - return the unit to them for repair. Sending me a new unit was out of the question which was not what I wanted to hear."
"Stop buying crappy Lenovo computer products! Sanction Lenovo! I purchased a laptop B560 in December 2010 from a Best Buy Store. Now, after a year and 4 months, the LCD starts flickering. I called Best Buy for help, they referred me to Lenovo 1800-426-7378 and then to 1-877-453-6686. I called them up and they said they will fix it free of charge. I e-mailed them the specifications right away. Today, I called the same number; the lady down in the Philippines named Sandy said she cannot confirm my warranty info on the computer. It looks to me that after one year warranty, the company erases all the consumer information from their system. I called Best Buy again today, and they cannot provide any assistance either. I tried the live chat on Lenovo website for technical support. They could not help me either."
"I want to inform you that I have purchased the Lenovo laptop on March 31, 2012. On Monday, June 4, 2012, when I opened the laptop after 1 hour from the same place untouched, what I have seen when I opened the laptop was it was broken from the right upper part. I was unable to understand how it could be possible when it was untouched and without having any accident, the laptop screen was broken. When I called up customer care, they asked me to take the laptop to the service center. I took my laptop to service center at the same time, but they have denied taking care of it by telling that it is not covered. They called the customer care and they asked me to talk to them. That customer care executive provided me the mail ID **."
"I ordered an IdeaPad Z570. After using it for less than a month, it died on me. I contacted Lenovo and the customer service was horrible. I kept on getting transferred from one department to another. Finally I was able to speak with a native English speaker. He told me they would send me a new computer. I held off because I wasn't sure if I wanted to return the computer for full refund. When I decided to stay with Lenovo I called back. I was told so many different stories. First I was told that I could get the computer back faster if I asked for a full refund and then re-ordered the computer online. I told CS rep that I would do this if I could get the same price for what I paid. He said he couldn't do anything about that. I told him it was unconscionable to charge me more for the same product. He then transferred me to someone else."
Unit became defective after a few months. Two parts casing on laptop started to open apart when notebook lid was raised. The unit is under 1 year depot service. I was told by the support team that the cost to repair was $180.
"They rushed me into ordering and made promises to expedite the delivery, but actually got worst and delayed in the following week (Lenovo Order **). I discussed the importance of the date of arrival and warned customer service ahead of time. Upon checking status of the order, I complained on the delivery date posted. Direct Lenovo customer service never responded to my emails. I like Lenovo products, but Lenovo has to do something with their customer service."
I came here to voice a complaint. I just experienced with Lenovo and I now realize I am just one of many customers who were frustrated enough to come here as a last resort to vent their dissatisfaction. Who knew this world class product line that IBM so delicately built has come to what it is. I will no longer think of ThinkPad in the same way.
"Ever since buying the Lenovo Idea Pad Z570, the internal Intel wireless 1000N adapter has not functioned properly. I visited the Lenovo support site and downloaded their latest driver for the laptop, but that didn't work to resolve the problem. Then I called Lenovo support, and they were able to log in to my PC, and download a different driver from their secret stash, which temporarily fixed the issue."

Then I called Lenovo support and they were able to log in to my PC and download a different driver from their secret stash, which temporarily fixed the issue. When the driver quit working and a subsequent call placed to Lenovo support, things had changed, I was told that the same issue doesn't qualify for free support and that I would have to pay $179.00 for a year of support or $59.00 per incident."
"I purchased 2 Lenovo Z565 laptops in November 2010.  Within 6 months, the door to the disc drives fell off both machines and now the hard drive on one is burned out.  I called the company.  What I got from the customer service department is that they do not stand by their products, that other people have had this problem within 2 months of having the laptop and that I should consider myself lucky.  One of the laptops is in the repair shop right now and it is going to cost me over $300.00 to repair."
"My Lenovo Y560 laptop failed under warranty. I got an RMA and they told me to ship it back in the original box. I did. I got the laptop back in a different box (I no longer have the original box), and they didn't fix it. I called again, they said they would send a new HD and restore CD. No problem. I'm very computer savvy. But they didn't send it. I called them to complain, no dice. I called consumer affairs, they told me they would send me a new HD and restore CD right away, and look into the box. I received the wrong restore CD and a 160 gb hard drive to replace my 500 gb hard drive. They claim to have included a label to send the old one back (which I won't until I get a 500 gb hard drive) but they didn't include a label."
"I have a complaint about one of your dealer (Best India Computers Valanchery, Kerala). They didn't give me the driver CD of Lenovo g460 idea pad laptop, so that I have so many problems. Please take proper action immediately."
"I purchased 2 laptops and paid over $10,000 for both from an authorized reseller of Lenovo (Ted from hidevolution.Com). I have spent the entire time being transferred from one customer relations person after another, never getting a first response, always having to send 2nd, 3rd and more email requests for a simple response and have finally now been told that the 2 computers I purchased are not covered by warranty. This is because they were purchased through e-bay, despite the fact that I only purchased 1 of the laptops via e-bay and the e-bay seller was in fact as I was told by numerous employees of Lenovo to be an authorized reseller."
"Worst customer service I have ever encountered. I thought Lenovo was going to be a big company that might care about customer service. I was extremely mistaken. Three weeks after I received my Lenovo Thinkpad E420, the computer would no longer start up. I sent it in to the repair depot and I received an email informing me that the part needed to fix the computer was out of stock and that there would be a delay. I waited over three weeks before they were able to send the computer back to me. A month after I received my ""fixed"" computer back, guess what? It happened again! I demanded a replacement computer, considering my computer was new and had not functioned the majority of the time I owned it. They took weeks transferring me from department to department and told me they would not replace the computer. I have no faith in their product, their personnel, their service and their company."
"By far, it is the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with. After two years of owning the laptop, the two USB ports on the side ruined two of my USB cables for two separate devices. The plastic piece inside comes out easily, which is a common Lenovo issue. Out of the 7 representatives I spoke to, it was nearly impossible to speak to a manager."
"I bought a Lenovo Ideapad Y560, refurbished, from the Lenovo factory outlet in March of 2011. Five minutes into the installation of the Windows 7 operating system, the computer blue screened. Since then, the longest it has gone without blue screening has been a little more than one week. I have sent it back to Lenovo's Repair Depot, at their request, three times. They re-imaged the hard drive, replaced the main board, replaced and imaged the hard drive again, and reset the memory modules. Each time, according to the repair technician, the computer passed hardware and functional tests."
"I hate their stupid customer service.  I have been told that I can't place an order, since my shipping address is different from my billing address! It's ridiculous!  I have never heard that before.  It has never happened with other online orders I placed.  Finally, I had to cancel the order three times, since each time I placed the order, it would not go through, and I got yelled by customer service people.  They have poor customer service. They have no respect."
"I bought a Lenovo Laptop (Model G570) on the 4th of November 2011 from one of the dealers in Bangalore, India.  It worked fine for a little over a month or so and then started giving problems.  Initially, it used to take longer time to boot which was irritating but I somehow used to bear it.  One fine day (actually worse day for me), when I switched it on, it only gave me a blank screen.  I then contacted the customer care (complaint # **) who took me through some ""one key recovery"" process and then a couple of other things, all of which didn't help at all."
"I bought a Lenovo Z570 on 10-24-11 from lenovo.com. I tracked the package and found out that it was being shipped from Shanghai, China. I didn't receive it till 11-4-11 since this was held for a couple of days in Louisville, KY (place where international packages from Lenovo come through to the US per customer service). Laptop was working well till 1-7-12. It wouldn't power up at all, neither with the battery nor with the adapter alone or together. I called Lenovo's support line. The tech tried to troubleshoot the problem but failed. He said it ""may be something to do with the power circuit"". My own research showed it to be the power jack. Tech said it needs to be sent to Texas for repairs. A 63-day old laptop needs repairs. I wouldn't have this as an answer, so tech support said he'll have his supervisors look into this case and that they'll call me back in 2-3 business days. I'm still waiting for Lenovo's response. By far, this is the worse computer I've had. Shame on IBM for marketing/producing such an inferior product. Overall experience is 1/2 star."
I have bought a Lenovo laptop computer in March 2011. It was under warranty and its keyboard started malfunctioning. I have sent it to Lenovo for repairs 3 times. Each time they send it back to me stating that it is fixed. It is still not fixed. Its warranty is going to expire two months later and they are only passing that time.
New laptop. Used for a month. The hard drive crashed and now their excuse for no hard drives is the flood in Thailand. This computer is junk. We should file a class action lawsuit.
"I bought a Lenovo desktop about 3 months ago. I use it sparingly for official work. A month ago, half the screen went black. The machine no. is TSOO107731. I contacted the contact nos. given; I think they were call center nos. They keep you on hold for long and then don't know what my problem is after I explain everything. Then I contacted the service center in India. Vaibhav/Vishal says it happens to Lenovo computers, the screen going black. My complaint no. was 4270395842. I regret buying a Lenovo. I even have a mac but have no problem for over a year. The guys at service says spares take 25 days, no parts available at Bangalore, so they're importing from china."
"I used the one-key rescue system to recover my lost data. I selected restore factory default settings then I lost all my data. The laptop became new as I had bought it on the first day then I shut it down. Then next day, I accidentally pressed the one-key rescue button. Now it doesn't start. It says media check disk failure then check cable with some error PXE : E61, PXE ROM."
"Not too happy with Lenovo. I purchased a computer 2.5 months ago and the hard drive is not working--it has died! When I called Lenovo, they basically told me that they are having problems with hard drives and they are on back order! Are you kidding me? I have only had this computer for less than 90 days and Lenovo doesn't care that this is a computer for my business and that I can't do anything until they send me a hard drive. I am about to scream. I will never buy another Lenovo computer and wish I could return this one! I gave this one star only because I could not choose zero."
"I purchased a Lenovo IdeaPad tablet and needed accessories to protect the unit from usage and upcoming trip.  I placed an online order on November 13, 2011 for the accessories.  The items are supposed to be shipped within 5 business days, and noted as ""in stock"".   It turns out that they were not in stock.  The company does not advise customer of changes in shipping dates.  The company is also unable to advise which retailers could have the accessories, as they do not keep a list of which retailers receive which products. Do you believe this?  Apparently, it is our responsibility to continue to check the status of the order, as they do not have a means to provide electronic updates."
"I ordered a Lenovo K1 32GB tablet on 11/16/11, and was told during the chat session, that I will receive it within 2 days.  After checking with another chat specialist I was informed it will take a week, however I did not receive it. I checked my order status to show that it was going to be 11/29/11, a week later than I was originally told.  Hence, I missed the Black Friday and Cyber Monday specials for tablets. I even purchased a Lenovo z570 notebook to be compatible with the K1 tablet. Around 11/28/11, I checked the status again, and now it said 12/7 which made me very upset, that not only am I not getting my tablet as mentioned, but I did not even get an email about the change. When I called on 12/5/11 to check on the status, to see if it was going to be shipped on 12/7/11, they said it was out of stock since it was on high demand, but I will get it later, which really made me mad."
"This issue is about the Lenovo Thinkpad Android Tablet. This unit is billed as a ""Business Class"" tablet, but has so far been a very serious disappointment. First, the unit, though billed as a ""Business Class Tablet"" is incompatible with Microsoft Exchange 2003. The email client cannot with any degree of reliability reply to received emails. Second, the unit has numerous manufacturing defects and/or design defects. These defects are actually documented, and largely ignored, on the company's own support forum."
"I sent in my unit for a broken digitizer after one month of use.  I got a phone call after it arrived for repair, saying it had a cracked screen.  I filed a complaint with UPS.  I found that the damage was not their fault due to faulty packaging.  Now they refuse to replace my unit.  Never buy Lenovo."
"I have purchased Lenova All in one on 27.04.2011 SR no ** . I have started receiving frequent flickering on the screen. I have logged a complaint with dealer and he tried to resolve the same. However, he fails to do so and advised us to take up with Lenova directly. I have logged a customer complaint no ** and when inquiring after few days, I have received feedback stating same was already closed and suggested me to log another complaint. I have logged another complaint no ** dated 17.10.2011. Their outsourced service partner M/s Blue com infosystem engineers visited 3 times in interval of 25 days after repeated follow up to their office,we have sent video shot of flickering screen to their mail ID, however problem is resolved. Feedback and service support is very poor. They have given 3 years warranty; however, with very poor service the network purpose of purchasing the system is not useful."
"I owned a Lenovo laptop for two years before suddenly, the right hinge/joint that holds the screen to the body of the computer snapped.  It wrecked the back cover instantly as well since the thick metal joint would not bend.  Knowing I was no longer under warranty, I tried to live with the problem for some time, but eventually knew I could not.  I took the laptop apart to discover that the only thing that held the joints together was a thin, cheap, plastic backing, which was the screen support as well.  It seemed so poorly designed.  I couldn't imagine it, but all I could do was order another part.  I did indeed find a place that carried the plastic screen support and ordered a new one.  And I got it gone but after a month, I faced the same problem.  Actually, the customer care told me that it’s technical fault.  Then, why should I suffer?  I invested 47000 Rs and it’s of no use.  Please take corrective action.  The model no. is 52q y510."
"In our computer (VS20035309), there is a technical problem. If you come and check the problem, then it is very helpful to me. Please come and solve my problem."
I've been on hold waiting for some one to pick up the phone for 25 minutes and still counting and I'm returning their technical support's call! This is the second time I've been on hold for 20 minutes plus out of three phone calls. Who allows this to happen anymore?
"My IdeaPad Y-450 came with the Windows Vista Home Premium. I installed Windows 7 Ultimate, without uninstalling Vista, around October 13, 2011. However, Windows 7 gave me some trouble and when I wanted to switch back to Vista, it asked me for the activation key. When I entered the activation key, I got the following error: Activation Error. Error code – 0xC004E003. It asked me to contact Lenovo Support."
"I could not talk to anyone in the USA or get my problem resolved, which is an embedded name on my computer that I bought from Circuit City, as they were closing down."
"My machine is under warranty with next business day service. My system has crashed and Lenovo is refusing to send an engineer out asking me to do diagnostics which cannot be done because the system has already crashed. The machine is gone together with loads of data. I lost time plus it may take quite a bit of money recovering the data apart from spending money to recover the system. I am considering a class action suit against Lenovo as I guess damages from one consumer will be very limited and not effective. If anyone else is interested, please leave a one-liner at the site and I can publish my email."
"In August 2010, I made an online purchase of a Lenovo Think Pad laptop, custom order for a total of 3,600 dollars. Due to the amount being more than the 2,000 limit on my bank card, I had to go through the hassle of calling my bank and getting the purchased approved before the order would go through. All of this time, I was making this transaction from a military base in Afghanistan. I received the laptop within the time frame stated by the company."
"I purchased a laptop March 17 of 2010. I was not happy with it and fought for 2 months and dozens of hours on the phone and email and finally got an RMA to return it. Then they said I had been issued a full refund once they received it back. I did receive the credit memo in the mail and even the credit number but I have never received my funds. It says my card was refunded on May 17, 2010. I have been paying for this on my credit card and carrying cost for 7 months."
"I purchased a Lenovo IdeaPad 2 years back. Its right hinge screen is breaking apart. Now, it seems that is a design issue with the product and lots of people have the same issue. Lenovo customer reps are even admitting to this when we called them, but for this to be fixed, the laptop needs to be in warranty. If this is a design issue, shouldn't Lenovo issue a recall and fix it? It is not my fault."
"I purchased a Lenovo W510 on 11/6/10 and received it 11/15/10. I loaded all my information on it on 11/15/10. On 11/16/10, I had to reboot the machine due to updates and now it won't boot up again so am returning it and buying a Dell."
"I have a Lenovo Ideapad computer that is still on warranty until March 2011. The computer started getting very hot near the power button and display The display is burned and the case started to melt. I stopped using it because of this clear fire hazard. When I spoke to the 1st of several reps, she told me that someone would be on the line shortly; she then tried to sell me an extended warranty. I refused, she told me that I would have to call back. Since then, I have spoken to two more reps who tried to sell me the extended warranty."
"I purchased this computer last November. I have returned it 3 times for a failed motherboard, no sound and the wireless failed. Each time, I have to send the computer and they don't provide a back up. I have ask for a new machine since this has been returned every 4 months. They have refused. I will never by this product again."
"I bought a Lenovo laptop, which is giving a problem in typing.  For example, whenever I have to type something, it's either the keyboard is not working or when it does work, the same key is pressed for endless times. Sometimes even if I don't open ""Help"", it opens automatically."
"Two months ago my Lenovo Y510 started crackling when I lifted the laptop monitor open. I didn't think anything of it until it started lifting the plastic on the right back corner of the keyboard base, which causes seam separation on the back, exposing wires."
"The DVD combo drive of my laptop stopped working last year and I have been following up with the customer care for more than 6 months now. The contacts given for customer support is useless, so I wrote a mail and sent many SMS on the given numbers. Finally, one day, the service center person called me and told me they are going to order a fresh part for replacement and will inform me. But no one has contacted me for more than two months now. I am highly displeased with Lenovo customer support. In my opinion, they are not capable of handling the business. I had availed an extended warranty with the belief that it would be used but I had to run to the service center at least four times for the same problem. I would recommend people never to buy a product, which has got to do anything to do with Lenovo, leave aside the computers."
"I have a Lenovo laptop, which was purchased on Feb. 3, 2007. I took the extended warranty package for a year in January of 2008 for a year, and again purchased this package in December 2009 for two years.  Hence, it should be valid until January 2011, but your company says it is valid for only January 2010, from the date of manufacturing. I don't know about this. I purchased the laptop on Feb. 3. it should start from that time, so I won't treat this situation in a good way."
"I am having a very frustrating experience with Lenovo Warranty Support Team. I bought a Lenovo Notepad in March 2007. The default 1 Year warranty expired in March 2008. The additional 2 Year Onsite warranty expired in March 2010. Since then, my experience with Lenovo Warranty Support Team has been no less than horrific. I am so frustrated that I have decided that I will never ever get associated with any other Lenovo product never ever again in future and neither would i recommend any of my friends of do so."
"Since Lenovo could not handle both issues, the first issue was opened Aug 11, next business day on site. 2 days later, Friday, the first tech guy came with all the wrong parts. Was supposed to come back on Monday. Since then I had to call every day to ask when they will come fix it, with a note 'parts are back ordered'. They came one more time, again, with the wrong part, and afterwards it was the same message again. It has been 16 days now! I do not understand how it can take that long with a Next Business Day support contract, for the first, trivial, issue. This is completely unacceptable."
"Basically, I bought a Lenovo sl400 laptop about a year and a half ago.  The warranty expires after a year.  I now have a broken left hinge.  It seems that if you put the words ""sl400 broken hinge"" into Google, you will see that I am not the only one with this problem.  Hundreds of consumers have the same issue.  They all have a broken left hinge.  I tried to talk with Lenovo but they keep hanging up on me.  They say that since the product is under warranty, they will not talk to me and they proceed to hang up."
"My story is similar to others here, and too long to tell, so I will not go into all the endless frustrating details.  It will only add to the countless hours I have wasted, dealing with my Lenovo computer, and their useless ""customer relations"".  I would only ask one question: Is there no way to hold this company accountable for gross irresponsibility to customers?  Many here have been ripped off, and even mistreated by so called ""Lenovo Customer Advocates"".  How is that possible?  It used to be that companies could be sued, or closed, for doing the kinds of things, or experiences, that were described here. I am appalled by what I experienced from Lenovo, and sorry to read that others suffered similarly.  Is there nothing that can be done to hold Lenovo responsible? Amazing."
"I purchased a Lenovo desktop computer for my husband for Christmas and recently have had nothing but issues with this computer. My husband and I have contacted Lenovo's customer service number multiple times in the last month and a half to try and get our computer fixed. The first time that we contacted Lenovo, we went through a series of things with them over the phone which did not work. Lenovo then decided that a repair man needed to come to our home. They only come out Monday-Friday between 8am-5pm. So with that being said, my husband needed to take time off of work."
"I had ordered Lenovo Notebook and was given delivery date of 5 days after the ordering date. When I checked the status of laptop after 5 days, I saw that laptop had been sent back to Japan due to custom issues. Again after 3 days, the laptop entered USA but got stuck due to insufficient documentation. Customer service personnel were discourteous and did not offer to speed up the delivery despite being told that I was traveling abroad for 3 weeks and having the system was essential. They threatened to charge penalty of 15% if order was cancelled. Is customer satisfaction not a criterion of Lenovo and are their customers representatives are not trained on how to deal with customers?"

"I have a problem with Customer Relations Manager Greg. I am actually requesting him an evidence of physical damage to my Lenovo t400 laptop (dead pixel). He is so mean and not ready to provide the evidence and I have a confidence that its not a physical damage. So please, kindly respond to my mail sir after all I am a student. Its not fair to be so mean to me. Thank you, looking forward for your help"
"Laptop : 46Q # EP08697462 Date of Purchase: 23/July/2008 Develop Problem: No Display Given for repair: 06/March/2010. This was duly repaired and handed over on 09/March/2010 date with a repair warranty of one month w.e.f. 09/March/2010. However, the repaired Laptop develop the same problem on 06/April/2010 i.e. under warranty date."
"On 31/07/2008,  I received a promotional call from Lenovo Company to buy Lenovo IdeaPad and was referred to the authorized dealer giving the details of the dealer, highlighting the 3 years of Warranty service if I buy the product today. I purchased a Notebook (Laptop) of Y510 series Lenovo IdeaPad Model 7758 Sr. No. ABQ0049817 ME 15799 laptop because of 3 years warranty service. My laptop Sr. No. and my all correspondence details, contact no. were registered there online in the showroom of the Dealer to avail the said warranty of 3 years. I confirmed there to do anything else; they replied, ""No need to do anything now."""
"Hi, I have purchased Lenovo warranty extension for 2 years from RT Outsourcing Services Ltd, New Delhi. I have paid Rs. 6000 on 31st December, 2009. There is a problem with my laptop. When I went to Lenovo Service Center at Bangalore, I was asked to send emails to different places, then when I contacted customer care, they are asking for invoice copies of the warranty extension, so creating an inconvenience to me."
"I bought Lenovo x300 a little over a year ago (it arrived on Jan 2009) and my battery died completely as of March 31, 2010! If it has 50-60% of its original lifetime, I can accept it although I wouldn't like it. But since it died completely, I cannot accept it at all. I called the Lenovo service and they told me they cannot cover it at all (and in a very rude way too!). I asked if Lenovo batteries can die completely in a year and three months and Kwame **, the supervisor of technical support refused to answer. I could only make him answer this question, ""Depending on the usage pattern, can the Lenovo batteries die out completely in a year and three months, and is it acceptable?"" and he said ""yes"" and told me I can quote him. He said that it is Lenovo's official answer and told me I can quote him (as long as I quote him literally) using his name."
"On February 23, 2010, my laptop T500, crashed, so I called their support hotline, the support tech walked me through their diagnostic test which was performed on my laptop but failed. So I called again, a UPS box from IBM was on order to my house so that I can return my laptop for repair. But to retrieve data back-up, I had to do it myself."
"As the new IT Director of a medium-sized business, I deal with repairs and warranty issues on previous computer purchases.  Unfortunately, some of these items are the Lenovo ""Ideapad"" netbooks.  One recently came back with no video.  I confirmed that the external video connection doesn't work either, which would point to the video card being faulty.  As an on board chip, this cannot be replaced by even an above average tech person.  I placed a call to Lenovo support and was told the netbook was two weeks out of warranty, but I could request a non-warranty repair."
"A month ago, I ordered a SL410 from Lenovo, and they told me that it takes 2 weeks to arrive. I was desperate about having the computer. Hence, I was calling them to ask about the progress of my order. The salesperson told me to wait for another week and try calling again. I waited for another week, and I called them. I was told that my computer takes another month to arrive. They said that they were experiencing delays with my order, and hence, my shipping time has been delayed."
"One year ago, I purchased a Lenovo small business desktop. The product came with a damaged hard drive and pixel issues. I had to send it back. They credited my account back and I ordered a new one. (This one I am putting my complaint against). I received the laptop, no problem. Over a month ago, I believe 1/2/10, I opened my laptop and the hinge came apart exposing the black wires. I have worked and been around computers and laptops for 15 years and never mistreated one or had something happen like this. My first call to them, they said I did the damage. They, basically, called me a liar over the phone. Speaking to the supervisor, he put the claim into a special services division to make a decision. They decided it was the laptop, not me, and I did not have to pay money. They send me back the laptop with the repaired hinge and also repaired the system board, not sure why."
"Please do not shop from Lenovo! On January 14, 2010, I placed my order through the customer service representative. The individual informed me that my unit will ship within 4 to 5 days. I called back after 5 days has passed to see the status of my order, since I never got a shipping confirmation email. The individual informed me that my order is on a back order and will ship out on the 25th of January."
"Lenovo sucks. That approach worked for Jeff Jarvis when he wanted to make a point, think I'll give it a try. Remember that old dis, ""**** you and the horse you rode in on""? Well, that's the way I feel about Lenovo Computers and the store where we purchased it, Best Buy."
"As part of employee purchase plan, I purchased a Y530 Lenovo laptop. After using the system for 2 months, I noticed a small dot on the upper right corner of the screen. Soon after 2 weeks, the dot developed into large area. I called Lenovo support and they asked me to send my laptop, even though I have a 3-year on-site warranty. Weeks went by and I did not receive any communication from Lenovo. I called them and was informed that my laptop was damaged by me and it was my responsibility to pay for the repair. Lenovo wanted me to pay $182, which I refused and got the laptop unrepaired back. No matter how many times I called to talk to a customer advocate, I was unsuccessful. I am planning to put the hardly used Lenovo in eBay and purchase an HP laptop. My advice is do not buy Lenovo. As any other Chinese goods, the quality is really bad and the service even worse. Now that IBM is out of the picture, buy some other American goods, even if it is Dell."
"As part of employee purchase plan, I bought a Y530 few months ago. The system was working for 2 months and then its monitor partially went out. Even though I had an on-site warranty, they made me ship the system to Texas. I did not hear from them for more than 2 weeks. When I called, technical support told me the damage was caused by the user and I needed to pay $182. This was really disappointing. I asked for a customer service rep but weeks went by and no one called me. So, now it's 5 weeks. My computer is in Lenovo shop. Multiple phone calls went without any response. I am in process of getting it back without repair and sell it as is at eBay. Good lesson not to buy anytime and anything from Lenovo. Lenovo sucks. I've never seen any company like Lenovo. Chinese need to learn customer service."
"I recieved a on line alert from my bank that I was overdrawn, upon checking there was a $989.00 charge from Lenovo. I had not ordered anything from them and my bank was able to cancel the hold on my money. This was done on a debit card and the charges were pending. I am in the process of trying to find out just what happened, but after reading so many complaints about this company, something should be done."
"I purchased a Lenovo 3000K100 desktop computer on 4/9/2008. I started having problems with it from the first day.  I tried to work with their technical support department.  Each time I called I was told to restore the system to factory settings, which means that all my additional softwear and files are lost.  I tolerated this for several months.  Now the system doesn't work at all.  They have replaced the hard drive, the mother board and 1 gig of memory but the system still doesnt work.  The tech depatment said I would have to wait 7-10 bs days for customer support to contact me because they are just getting too many calls. I asked for a refund as the warranty hasn't expired and they couldn't promise me anything.  At the present time I am stuck with a computer and technical support that is worthless."
"I ordered a SL300 Thinkpad laptop from Lenovo website. I have been experiencing problems since I got it. Lenovo had not tested the laptop fully before sending it to me and the laptop was shipped directly from the factory in China. The problems are countless, and each each showed up slowly. Sometimes the volume buttons would not work, and they did not give any software for the webcam. The battery was the worst. Even when I put it in sleep mode, it would be consumed. It made my laptop so hot once. And the worst thing is that the windows closed several times unexpectedly, and I lost so much of my work and the desktop doesn't show up. I called them many times. But the technical department would tell me to call the sales dept. and vice versa. I wasted so much of my time calling them. And all they say is that If you return the laptop we will charge you 15% restocking fee. It was the worst purchase ever for me. The customer service was the worst too."
"Hi, I am small computer reseller in Jakarta - Indonesia. I have a case regarding Lenovo responsibility on warranty and business trade acts. Furthermore, my company have suffered much about many irresponsible selling practices that may pinpoint toward business crime and dumping acts. I wonder whether I am qualified to send you my case."
Sir
I sent my computer to get fixed( under warranty) waited for two days to get a box from them to send it. Received the computer back with the same problem as before it got sent a week later and now two weeks later I still have the computer not working and 5 hours invested in a company which has no complaint department.No one has accepted responsability in this issue.
"UPS delivered a box that contained a Lenovo computer. I had not ordered a computer, and there was no invoice in the package or other documentation concerning the order or purchase.I therefore  thought it must be a gift from someone. Several weeks later , UPS appeared and said they were directed  to pick something up.I had not ordered a UPS pickup, told UPS so, and asked who had ordered the pickup. The UPS man responded that that the pickup was ordered by Lenovo. On my next credit card statement, there was a charge of $1,241.74 from Lenovo.Since I had not made any purchase from Lenovo, I reported the charge as unauthorized and likely fraudulent, and cancelled the credit card (to avoid more bogus charges)."
"I purchased a computer in October 2007. My first problem came only a few months after. I sent the computer in; it got fixed (a new hard drive was put in) and when it was returned to me, I began to use it. A few months after that, I had to send back for another hard drive. I have periodic issues with this computer and I have had to reinstall the operating system from the ThinkVantage option. Recently, just after Thanksgiving 2008, the operating system had to be reinstalled... again! The company sent me some CDs to help fix it and I used the computer in safe mode for a week."

"Dec 1, bought online a Thinkpad t61 from Lenovo site. A refurbished unit for $903.00. I told the salesperson I needed it quickly, as my husband and I were leaving the country for the winter Jan 1. The unit did not arrive until Dec 12. I charged it that evening,and turned it on in the morning-a horizontal line directly in the center of the screen appeared and would not go away. I called the tech at Lenovo, who said get on the site at Lenovo and find a service provider and take it to them to fix. As it was Saturday, only one person called me, and indicated the nearest provider for the warranty is in San Francisco, 4 hours away, so I would have to ship it. I called the sales line on Monday the 15th, as directed by the weekend staff, and was told I had to have the unit repaired, and I would have to ship it. I told her about my time constraint, and I would have to return the unit. She told me then I would be subject to the 15% restocking fee. I would not object if this was just a decision on my part to return it , but I feel I did not get what I ordered, a computer that worked correctly, and that contract was now void. I sent it back, and emailed my concerns to Lenovo, with a request to respond, but have not received an email back, it's been over a week. I would like any help on this matter to receive my full purchase price on this defective unit."
We have purchased one Lenovo PC set on Feburary 2008.Its under guarantee now cz 1 year is nt comleted.
I talked with this sales executive for buying a new 2 year warranty for my thinkpad R61. She quoted a rate of $207.20 and then charged my credit card $217.
"My nightmare began on 9/24/07 when I had to call Lenovo for the first of many problems with my new computer that I just paid $2400 for. It has been sent back 8 times. System board has been replaced twice. By this time, they told me my computer was out of warranty and I argue that it has been sent to them 7 times in warranty. On 8/27/09, Ray ** called and said they sent the wrong system board and he was going to replace it with a new computer. He said someone will call and get info on all components that were on the previous machine."
I bought a Lenovo NB Laptop 52Q Model on 25 April 2008. Five months are just passed that a crack has occured itself in its body at the joint of opening it. I took the laptop to the dealer but the dealer answered that you will have to install the whole plastic body at your cost.The cost he told is Indian RS.7000 to 8000. The Gurantee Period prevails. Please help to replace the damaged body portion as cost-free.
"Similar to Joseph (see below), I ordered a Lenovo laptop to be delivered to a different address.  They simply couldn't figure out how to do this.  After three weeks of waiting, they replied to my complaint, simply saying that the order had been canceled."
"August 7, 2008 I placed an order of my T400 Lenovo laptop. It was shipped on 09/01/08 and I've received the PC on 09/05/08 and I 've received price match for my order as well.  I was happy to work on my new T400 when I received it. I did configuration by following the steps the PC popped and created the rescue DVDs. I turned off the laptop after that and tried to turn it on again to install some software but I cannot.  I called the support center for help and followed the instructions provided by the representative (removing the battery and power supply, pressing power button ten times and hold for 20 seconds, connecting to the external LCD, but the laptop still cannot be turned on)."
"August 29, 2008 I am writing this to express my extreme dissatisfaction with Lenovo.  My daughter, would be attending Northern Arizona University on August 22, 2008 and would require a Laptop computer.  Since I previously had purchased a T61 Thinkpad for myself, I decided to purchase one for my daughter to be shipped out to an address in AZ to avoid having to hand carry it and many other moving in items since we would be travelling from New Jersey. I placed the order late online on 8/6/2008 and paid extra for 2 day delivery."
two months before i have purchased a laptop(model:Lenovo ideapad y-510) it is frequently hanging i cant work even 10miniutes with that system i dont know what i have to do.
"Ordered a laptop computer on the website for 699 dollars.  The computer came with great specs: 2.1 Ghz core 2 duo. 4 GB ram. 512 mb ati video card. 250 GB HDD. 17 inch monitor.  Once ordered with these specific stats, checked order status on email.  Order name and specifications changed completely from the website summary sheet to the email sent (1 gb ram, 120 Gb hd, intel dual core processor)."
I paid for new T61 and got it on 05/09/08.
Worst Customer Service.  Agents totally junk. Cannot even type an US address. Sent CD's to Pennsylvania instead of Texas.  Secnd time missed apt number. The service partition doesnt work either.
Having a laptop computer that is defective and unable to return for credit. Poor customer support; denied to return the defective product within 30 days of receipt (of the product).
"I puchased a new Lenovo model 3000 N100 laptop for my wife's birthday present.  I wanted her to have a high quality laptop, with built in one button recovery features, the latest OS, easy to us security (fingerprint scanner) basically a hassle free environment for work as she is not very computer literate. VISTA Premium turned out to be a poor replacement for XP.  This OS clearly requires more resources than this Lenovo model possesses to run well.  Frequent lockup, slow boot and shut downtimes (by contrast, XP will boot up and shutdown in the same amount of time that VISTA takes to boot up) Why Lenovo offered VISTA on this model is beyond reason.  They offered the same model with XP on their website, but it was $200 more, and being ignorant of VISTA's issues at the time of purchase, I went with the better price.  I contacted Lenovo support to inquire if I could swap hard drives for one with XP Pro on it, but never received a response."


"On Wednesday, Feb. 13, I ordered a new X61 from the Lenovo outlet. I chose the outlet as I found one configured exactly as I wanted, and being an off the shelf item I figured I would get it quicker than ordering a CTO. I ordered it with my debit card and waited patiently for order confirmation and shipping estimate. On Friday, Feb. 15, I recieved an order confirmation with an estimated ship date of 02/22. I was very excited to get my new laptop. 30 minutes later I received another order confirmation with a different order number, but for the same laptop."
"I purchased a X61s laptop in December.  On February 10th, while in use, the machine just went black.  Turned out there was a battery failure.  Upon calling Lenovo, they were willing to honor the warranty, but just getting a battery will take a week.  They are very understanding, but do nothing whatsoever to keep a high end business machine in service."
"I bought a laptop at Circuit City on September 3, 2007. After four months, on January 2008, the screen had some black spots on it. I called the manifacturer, Lenovo; they told me to send it back to check, and they called me to inform me that the screen had a crack on it. The crack was not there when I sent the laptop. It was a manufacturer defect."
Lenovo's Support Service Debacle:  It's all here and more to come. http://syntric.blogspot.com/2008/02/lenovos-700-support-debacle.html


"I've purchased a Lenove 3000 N100 0768 HCQ Model laptop on 5 July 07   .  I have given my laptop for repair almost 6-7 times and have been constantly following up with them for the rectification of the problem. My USB Drive intermittently stops working. On speaking to them, they always say to leave my laptop with them for 2 days, and we will correct it; but it has never happened. Now they say that they are awaiting for the new parts to come.  The laptop is still in warranty, and now I seriously feel that it has to be replaced rather then just running around the service center to get it repaired.  Please look into the matter and try to resolve this issue."
"I purchased a laptop from Lenovo, and the memory card reader was not working. I went to the service center, got a replacement certificate, gave it to the dealer, and the dealer gave it to the place from where he purchased; but it has been already been more than 4 months. I have not received it yet."


"I ordered a Lenovo laptop over the internet; what I received was an IBM laptop which was old stock.  None of this was mentioned on the internet or in any of the information concerning the order.  When I called, was told that it didn't matter, it was the same product.  The customer service department did not want to make any effort to resolve my problem; they hung up on me several times and refused to let me talk to a supervisor.  There is also a 15% restocking fee that was not mentioned anywhere when the order was placed. When I finally was able to talk to the supervisor in Toronto, he was indifferent to my concerns and abrupt in his response.  I have had an IBM Thinkpad for years and have always been satisfied with their service: not any more.  I am returning the Lenovo and will not buy any of their products.  They have lost a customer permanently."
"I ordered from IBM an R61i notebook computer fully loaded. IBM was 4 weeks late in the delivery. Then it came with a bad motherboard. I spent 2 weeks and 80 hours of my time calling the tech line before they decided to believe me, and tried to make me send it in, even though I paid for the in office repair. Once that was done, the client security program will not work. This was one of the reasons I bought this notebook with a finger print reader. IBM considers this a freebie program, and wants to charge me an additional $100 to make it actually work. They obviously do not care about the individual consumer. They are so consumed with trying to save a penny, they are obvlivious to the thousands they are loosing when the customers refuse to subject themselves to the apathy and contempt from Lenovo customer service."
"I ordered a Lenovo Laptop Model 3000 V200. I used MSN and signed up for the $10 monthly fee. Then, I could not use Google.  I de-installed MSN, and even Internet Explorer would not work. Lenovo / Microsoft is controlling the information I can use.  As a scholar, I find this unacceptable.  I called Lenovo's HELP number and learned that I could take the OS back to its out-of-the-box state using F11 during startup.  That was no help, because the machine prohibits me from using information sources of my own choosing."
"I ordered a T61 from lenovo for $913.41.  By the time it arrived, I checked the price on their website, it had dropped to $895.03..  so I called the lenovo for a pricematch, they asked me to generate a quote with the same hardware (so i used the same method as i placed the order).  I called them back with the quote number and my original order number, but they were not able to do the pricematch because they said the order Partnumbers were not exactly the same for quote and original order."

"I have ordered an Lenovo laptop with the order #2C4VJ5 in June 2007.  Lenovo informed me in August 2007 that the model was no longer available. The sales rep on the phone tries to bait-and-switch me to a more expensive laptop. I said no and finally got Lenvo to offer me a similar laptop with no cost to you.  As you are aware, many consumer electronic product goes down in price over time and Lenovo tries to increase the price.  I have never had a problem with Lenovo when IBM was the owner."
"I bought a Lenovo 3000 Y series laptop. After 1 month a vertical line has appeared in its LCD screen. Forget about repairing it, for the past 1 month I have lost a fortune calling up different numbers as given in the website none of which is correct. Whenever i call up the main office in Bangalore they give me a new toll free number and they do not work. I have also been given 3 different service centre addresses which keep changing. Now the shop that I bought it from have also thrown Lenovo out of their business for their poor service."
After reading all the nightmares about Lenovo's problems fulfilling orders on this machine I ended up calling about my early July T61P order (after multiple emails were ignored.)

"On 5/10, I ordered a T61 model laptop from Lenovo.  Shipping date was 6/4- though it was longer than the 1-2 weeks advertised ship date-I figured it was a new model and it might take longer.  On 5/30, I received an email about a delay and the order status read it would be shipped 8/30."
"I am a blind individual that relies on a computer for daily activity, and everyday necessities at times. At the turn of the year, it was time for me to get a new computer. I checked into Dell, Gateway, HP/Compaq and Lenovo. Making my decision, I bought the Lenovo thinkpad, having to borrow quite a bit of money for it. I planned on using this machine to go to school, which means I must rely on computers to read my text books, and I definitely need a computer if I am going to go for software engineering."
I bought a TOP OF THE LINE IBM THINK PAD computer in 2004. It has not worked right since it was delivered. It always ran HOT - so hot I couldn't touch it after an hour working on it and I had to shut it down.
I bought a Leveno  desk top about 3 months ago. Ever since I got it things haven't been right.
Lenovo had a substantial rebate offer on it's N100 -- $350. The catch is that it is impossible to register online. After repeatedly filling in a long form I am advised that an unexpected error has occurred and that I must get out of the browser and start over.
"I have a 1 year old IBM/Lenovo G41 laptop with a 3 year on-site warranty/sevice contract. It has now been out of service for 1 week and after three attempts to fix it, they are now saying that the needed part is out of stock and even though it is in a warehouse in China, it won't be available for 3 weeks. I have requested a call from a manager for the past 4 days and despite several promises of a call, I received none. The contract says they will repair or replace. They are doing neither."
